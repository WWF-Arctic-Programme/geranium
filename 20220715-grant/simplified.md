Geranium has a consistent language and documentation understandable for the intended users
	
Geranium is able to produce individual instant reports for PACs or other Arctic subregions as requested by a user

Elaborated individual reports for selected PACs, LMEs and other subregions in relation to human uses and potential conservation measures needed for selected PACs and other subregions based on the instant Geranium reports are prepared for further discussion and consideration by the ArcNet working group and finalized for external use.

Clear, consistent and user-friendly descriptions of each human use included into analysis are incorporated in Geranium interface

Compatibility assessment decisions made by scientists organised in a systematic and easily accessible way in Geranium interface. A relevant comment is included in the instant reports

Gaps in data/assessment discrepancies identified and questions and terms of references for reviewers/consultants prepared to prove and independently verify the assessment made by the ArcNet scientists

International reviewers identified and a review organised for each thematic or/and human use assessment used for Geranium

Geranium assessment improved and independently verified following the review

Existing/available to WWF Sight human use data is incorporated into Geranium interface and structure

Gaps in human use data identified and the next steps to possibly obtain this data are proposed
	
Conservation Action Hotspots based on the overlaps between the compatibility assessment data and the human uses data identified and described

A regional face-to-face workshop is organised and facilitated to trial Geranium (and Chikory) as a stakeholder engagement and visualisation tool

An expert report summarising findings based on the Geranium analyses is prepared
