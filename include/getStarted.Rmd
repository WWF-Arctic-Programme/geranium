As we have your attention:
<br><br>
While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, and consistency of the conservation concern assessments, we recognise the inherent challenges linked to the Geranium approach and tool in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment such as the Arctic. Given the scarcity of data, the continuous development of new industries and practices, and ongoing research on the impact of human activities on biodiversity, you are advised to exercise your own judgement and discretion when interpreting the data and assessment presented on this site, are encouraged to cross-reference the information provided with authoritative sources, and when unsure seek professional advice.
<br><br>

If you identify inaccuracies in the data or assessment and wish to contribute to Geraniumâ€™s improvement, you are encouraged to reach out to the developers at ArcNetinfo@arcticwwf.org. Your feedback is valuable and assists us in refining and enhancing the tool for the benefit of all users.
