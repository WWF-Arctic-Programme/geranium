<h2><strong>Tourism</strong></h2>
<p>Tourism is a growing industry in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Usually considered as a positive, a way to make conservation profitable however overtourism is a common problem around the world, and in the Arctic it can be especially harmful as its nature is fragile and slow to recover.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the assessment tourism was divided into 2 categories:</p>
<div id="ecotourism" class="section level3">
<h3>Ecotourism</h3>
<p>It is defined as “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the wellbeing of local people and involves interpretation and education” (International Ecotourism Society, 2015 citation by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489119177"><u>Encyclopedia of the World's Biomes, 2020</u></a>) and includes small-ship expedition cruises and other small-scale tourism activities. It is characterized by a rather small number of visitors, and absence or minimal amount of permanent infrastructure.</p>
<p>Expedition ships generally do not land more than 100 passengers at the same site at once and follow industry-specific guidelines e.g. developed by <a href="https://www.aeco.no/"><u>AECO</u></a>.</p>
<p>On the one hand the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems from ecotourism is minimal because of its scale and regulations it follows, on another hand tourists intend to see the most valuable and vulnerable areas and wildlife - seabird colonies, walrus and seal haul outs, whale aggregations etc. Existing world examples show that a rise in a number of visitors can easily overcome nature’s capacity unless regulated.</p>
<p>Therefore a control and regulations for ecotourism are needed and it is not necessarily compatible with conservation goals of the ArcNet just by definition. Regulation should not be outsourced to the industry associations like AECO but should be done by a conservation community in partnership with other stakeholders instead.</p>
<p>Examples of restrictions in addition to existing environmental standards and best practices can be use of LFO instead of HFO, specific site visiting and wildlife watching guidelines and site management plans, specified seasons when visitors are not allowed in a particular area, restriction on use of motorboats etc.</p>
<p><em>Associated impacts:</em> disturbance of animals, physical disturbance of habitats, pollution (including biological pollution - introduction of invasive species, pathogens and diseases); in case of ship-based tourism all ship-associated impacts including underwater noise, light pollution, disturbance of ice habitats (ice breaking), risks of ship strike for mammals and birds.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> expedition cruises by AECO tourist operators.</p>
<p>Ecotourism industry is among the most obvious allies and partners in conservation and thus should be actively involved in conservation planning and decision making.</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> marine mammal conservation features are quite diverse and include small, locally restricted, stable and very well-defined habitats –i.e. coastal haul out sites for walruses and eared seals, seasonal aggregation core areas for some philopatric cetaceans like beluga whales and narwhal; majority of conservation features are more widespread and dynamic though quite restricted in space seasonal key habitats - summer feeding areas, whelping and moulting patches. For some species or populations these habitats are not very well studied and defined e.g. for the Barents-Kara-Laptev beluga whale stock.</p>
<p>Depending on the status of a habitat scale, importance and sensitivity the assessment outputs for marine mammals vary from “Significant impact” for polar bear denning sites and steller sea lion haul outs and sea otter breeding sites to “Notable impact” for majority of the habitats and to “Minor (and transitory) impact”.</p>
<p>As most of the habitats are seasonal the restrictions are also temporary and seasonal. Restrictions include wildlife watching guidelines, speed limitations for ships in mammal aggregation areas, marine mammal observers on board, specific site guidelines. This is best done at a regional and a local scale.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> seabird conservation features in ArcNet can be divided into three types - bird colonies and buffer zones around them (feeding areas), breeding grounds and non breeding bird habitats with moulting, migrating, and wintering aggregations.</p>
<p>All these habitats are used seasonally, meaning that birds present there only in certain months of their annual cycle and leave them for the rest of a year. Ecotourism is also a seasonal activity - it does not require permanent, year-round infrastructure and by definition is organised in a way not to leave lasting impact. Therefore the assessment results vary for seasons when birds are present in a habitat and when they are not.</p>
<p>Seasonal activity of ecotourism is mostly overlapped with seasonal habitat use by seabird conservation features by definition. Thus, for almost all habitats ecotourism impact requires mitigation through activity-specific and/or habitat/ biotope-specific considerations if the activity takes place when birds are using the habitat and is assessed as having minor (and transitory) impact when birds are not using the habitat.</p>
<p>Regulations should include wildlife watching guidelines and specific site guidelines determining no go zones and areas where visits are allowed. This is best done at a local scale (i.e. developing site management plans). In some areas (e.g. migrating birds concentration areas in the Chukchi and Bering Sea) black outs on the vessels might be needed to avoid bird strikes during night time.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> as the impacts of ecotourism are relatively minor and of small scale and conservation features representing diversity of fishes are in contrast presented at a coarse scale, there are no specific fish-related regulations and restrictions for tourism other than existing environmental standards and best practices.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> benthic features in the assessment are represented by distinctive deep sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts, underwater mountains and areas of increased benthic biomass. These objects currently and in the foreseeable future are accessible only for occasional visits done predominantly by scientists not by tourists, therefore they were assigned “not applicable” status.</p>
<p>Some of the benthic features include shallow water and coastal elements like kelp forests and seagrass meadows. Ecotourism in these areas assessed as having Notable impact, meaning that related risks require mitigation through activity-specific and/or habitat/ biotope-specific considerations if the activity takes place to ensure the activities do not damage kelp communities and seagrasses: limited use of motor boats, speed limits and specific site guidelines directing boat traffic out from the most valuable and dense parts of the meadows and kelp forests. This is best done at a local scale with development of site management plans.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features</em>: ecotourism causes risks of notable impact on the areas where coastal conservation features such as estuaries, salt marshes and intertidal zones are to be conserved. Certain restrictions should be applied to ensure conservation and wellbeing of these features. Specific site guidelines, caps on a number of visitors are among these measures.</p>
<p>There are no specific restrictions for ecotourism in the vicinity of glacial termini apart from existing environmental standards for the industry and safety measures. However, seabird and mammals feeding aggregation at glacier fronts should be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div id="mass-tourism" class="section level3">
<h3>Mass tourism</h3>
<p>It is characterised by large-scale and developed infrastructure including roads and pathways, guest houses, peers, parking lots, cafes, souvenir shops etc). Vessel based mass tourism can use large cruise ships (over 400 passengers) and also numerous small boats in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Mass tourism can be destructive, however can be allowed in some areas where key conservation features are less exposed to its impacts due to their biological characteristics, seasonal or spatial mismatch. Additional requirements and conditions can be introduced besides general environmental requirements to the industry. Speed regulations for vessels and vehicles, onboard marine mammal observers, use of electric engines or LFO (Light Fuel Oil) for ships can be among such additional requirements.</p>
<p><em>Associated impacts</em>: ship-associated (see Shipping Chapter), coastal infrastructure-associated (see Infrastructure Chapter) impacts, specific impacts - animal disturbance, physical disturbance of the habitats, pollution including noise and light, waste, and biological pollution (alien species, pathogens and diseases).</p>
<p>Examples of mass tourism in the Arctic are polar bear watching tourism in the Churchill area, the Canadian Arctic, cruise industry in waters of Alaska or Norway.</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Almost all marine mammal habitats considered for the assessment are seasonal meaning that animals use them only in certain months and leave for the rest of a year. Therefore, the assessment status may vary for different seasons except for the general requirement to avoid construction of permanent infrastructure in key mammal habitats. Mass tourism causes risks of significant impact in small, locally restricted, stable, and very well-defined habitats especially during the seasons when animals are present there. The impact can be characterised as “Notable” in other seasons primarily under conditions that it leaves no trace.</p>
<p>Other restrictions for the seasons when animals are present can include HFO ban, speed limits, marine mammal observers on board, shipping routes planning, zoning etc.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> Seabird conservation features in ArcNet can be divided into three types - bird colonies and buffer zones around them (feeding areas), breeding grounds and nonbreeding bird habitats with aggregations during moulting, migrating, and wintering aggregations.</p>
<p>All these habitats are seasonally used, meaning that birds present there only in certain months of their annual cycle and leave them for the rest of a year. Therefore, the assessment status may vary for different seasons except for the general requirement to avoid construction of permanent infrastructure in key bird habitats. Among the restrictions are introduction of site-specific guidelines, blackouts for cruise ships in migrating bird concentration areas in nighttime to prevent bird strikes etc.</p>
<p>Note that the assessment is done at a coarse, global scale and in some cases it can be reconsidered once a more fine scale data is introduced. For example, current assessment for yellow-billed loon (<em>Gavia adamsii</em>) Atlantic wintering grounds for mass tourism says “Notable impact. Regular bird concentration areas must be identified and avoided”, meaning that at the finer scale the assessment outputs will be “Significant impact” for the regular/known bird concentration areas and “Notable impact” or “Minor (and transitory) impact” for the areas in a distance from concentration areas. This applies to many seabird conservation features and is highlighted in the comments section.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> conservation features representing diversity of fishes are presented at a coarse scale, and there are no specific fish-related regulations and restrictions for tourism other than existing environmental standards and best practices - measures to prevent oil spills, introduction of invasive species and waste pollution.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> benthic features in the assessment are represented by distinctive deep-sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts, underwater mountains and areas of increased benthic biomass. It is not expected that mass tours to visit these objects will be organised in the foreseeable future however these areas should be considered as special areas where all measures to avoid any pollution from passing ships to be taken. Some of the benthic features include shallow water and coastal elements like kelp forests and seagrass meadows. Tourism in kelp forest areas requires mitigation through activity-specific and/or habitat/ biotope-specific considerations: only a limited scale of potential activities, no permanent infrastructure construction, limited use of motorboats, speed limits and specific site guidelines directing boat traffic from the most valuable and dense parts of kelp forests. Mass tourism has a significant impact on seagrass meadow areas because of the high sensitivity of this habitat. Related risks are assessed as non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> Mass tourism has a significant impact on the salt marsh areas and intertidal zones due to their sensitivity. It has notable impact when it is conducted at a limited scale in other coastal feature areas. First, there should be no permanent infrastructure construction, individual site guidelines should be developed to direct traffic and outline no-go zones. More specific restrictions and guidelines should be introduced at regional and local scale.</p>

<h2><strong>Infrastructure</strong></h2>
<div id="submarine-communication-and-power-cables" class="section level3">
<h3>Submarine Communication and Power Cables</h3>
<p>This activity includes laying and maintenance of submarine communication cables. In the Arctic, this human use of the ocean is currently rather limited but plans to develop cable communication are ambitious and the progress over recent years is fast.</p>
<p><em>Associated impacts</em> are rather minor, limited in space and in time and include noise and light pollution from laying and service ships, risks of fuel leaks and physical disturbance for seafloor communities and habitats.</p>
<p>Once a cable is laid its impact on biodiversity is minor.</p>
<p>Specific requirements for this human use are applied primarily to the installation phase. They include avoiding areas of critical importance and often of high seasonal animal concentration (whale feeding grounds, seabird moulting sites, fish spawning areas) and keep a distance from marine mammal and seabird aggregations which are normally dynamic and therefore require observers on board. To avoid all-year-round areas of critical importance such as benthic and coastal features more detailed surveys, mapping and planning are needed at a local or a regional scale.</p>
<p>Interesting to note that as Wikipedia puts it: “As a result of these cables' cost and usefulness, they are highly valued not only by the corporations building and operating them for profit, but also by national governments. For instance, the Australian government considers its submarine cable systems to be "vital to the national economy". Accordingly, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) <strong>has created protection zones</strong> that restrict activities that could potentially damage cables linking Australia to the rest of the world. The ACMA also regulates all projects to install new submarine cables”.</p>
<p>Examples of submarine communication cables in the Arctic include Svalbard Undersea Cable System (since 2004), Greenland Connect system connecting Greenland, Canada and Iceland since 2009 and many others. There are plans for more such cables in the Arctic including Polar Express with the aim to connect Russian Arctic settlements from Murmansk to Anadyr and further south by 2026 by laying more than 12 000 km of cables according to the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/"><u>Submarine Cable Map</u></a>. Canada is planning to lay Kattittuq Nunavut Fibre Link from Newfoundland to Iqaluit by 2025 as well. These plans along with others can be explored as potential opportunities for conservation and monitoring.</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Installation works can have significant impact on small, spatially restricted, stable, and well-defined habitats such as core summer habitats for species like beluga and narwhal during the seasons they use these habitats. Works have notable impact on other important marine mammal habitats requiring specific consideration like having marine mammal observers on board and keeping at least 10 km distance from aggregations of beluga whales and 5 km from aggregations of other cetaceans, and that work to be stopped if they approach. There is no particular distance to keep outlined for seals and walruses, however it is important that in case cables are laid in walrus habitats, they should lay deep enough not to be damaged by feeding walruses.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> In general, there is a requirement to avoid areas of seasonal bird concentrations and areas regularly used by birds while installing the cables. Works can have a significant impact on specific critical habitats (such as moulting sites and migration stopovers or in the close proximities to the breeding colonies) during the time of their use. Cables should avoid critical habitats of benthic feeding sea ducks such as moulting sites or migration stopovers.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> Most of the conservation features representing diversity of fishes are presented at a coarse scale and therefore no specific restrictions on development of submarine cable networks are proposed. However, in some spatially restricted spawning areas of mass, commercially important species such as Atlantic capelin, Atlantic herring a ban on any works proposed during the spawning season. There are also year-round restrictions proposed on the works in important semi-enclosed water bodies such as river estuaries.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> the assessment concludes that the submarine cable related works can have notable impact on the assessed benthic features and therefore they shall be done at limited scale only and under condition that a more precise planning is done, and the most important parts of the features are avoided.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> it is suggested that works related to the submarine communication cable laying and maintenance can have notable impact on coastal features and therefore can proceed only at limited scale while avoiding the most important areas within coastal features. This is best done with planning at a local and regional level.</p>
</div>
<div id="underwater-oil-gas-pipelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Underwater Oil &amp; Gas Pipelines</h3>
<p>Underwater pipelines are used for oil and gas transportation between production sites and consumers, storage facilities, or terminals. Sometimes they are relatively short - a few kilometres and connect the offshore facility with a coast (Norway) or vice versa (Varandey, Russia), sometimes they can be as long as thousands of kilometres connecting opposite sides of the seas.</p>
<p>Pipelines are associated with localised disturbance and destruction of benthic habitats, noise and physical disturbance at the construction phase and risks of leakages and accidental spills.</p>
<p>Existing oil &amp; gas pipelines in the Arctic region are short and connect production sites with export terminals or connect two coasts of a bay (Baydaratskaya Bay, Russia).</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Consensus is that pipelines cause risks of significant impact for the key habitats due to the risks of large-scale damage in the case of a spill. Pipelines can be located in some habitats where animals are less abundant, and their densities are lower such as whelping or feeding areas for ringed or bearded seals or areas used by polar bears. General rule is to avoid seasons when animals use the habitat for the construction works, avoid regular or dense animal concentration areas, have marine mammal observers on board and make sure works paused in case marine mammals approach the construction site (in case of whales 5 km zone is recommended).</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> Similar approach as for marine mammals – pipelines will have significant impact if located in the vicinity of breeding colonies and other well-defined concentration areas (moulting and wintering sites or migration stopovers). They will have notable impact on other habitats and thus can be constructed/used under condition that animal concentrations are avoided, and strict and robust monitoring of installed pipes is implemented.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> General approach is that pipelines can be laid in the areas important for fish under condition that the strictest environmental requirements and precaution measures are taken during the construction, and a robust monitoring system is installed during the exploitation. Construction works will have significant impact if carried out during spawning seasons for some fish species such as capelin, herring or cod which should be avoided.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> As pipelines impact benthic features the most, the assessment declares related risks as non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations if pipelines are laid in the areas where key benthic features are to be conserved.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> The assessment declares pipelines related risks as non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations for the areas where key coastal features are to be conserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="offshore-wind-farms" class="section level3">
<h3>Offshore Wind Farms</h3>
<p>Offshore wind farms are seen as a green and renewable energy source and a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel. They are also getting more and more efficient and viable economically and thus are more likely to be more widely used in the future.</p>
<p>However, they are <em>associated with the impacts</em> like significant noise pollution, risk of seabirds being struck by blades, and behaviour of fishes, birds and marine mammals altered (with attraction or avoidance for different species). Among the important <span style="color: #yellow;">effects of wind farms is the unintentional provision of a new habitat which can be rapidly colonised by hard substrate benthic species including alien and invasive species.</span> Turbine installation process is associated with high level of underwater noise, light pollution, alteration of benthic habitats (in case it is a fixed turbine) and all the impacts from service ships which can include potential petrochemical pollution. More about environmental impacts of offshore wind parks: <a href="https://tethys.pnnl.gov/wind-energy"><u>https://tethys.pnnl.gov/wind-energy</u></a>.</p>
<p>Fixed wind farms are usually installed at depths less than 40-50 metres. There are also floating wind farms with turbines mounted on floating platforms, which can be installed at depths ranging from ca. 100 m. to ca. 500 m. This technology is still in its <u><a href="https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/checkpoint/arctic/challenges/windfarm-siting#:~:text=Offshore%20wind%20parks%20had%20not,wind%20turbines%20do%20not%20allow.">infancy</a></u> and not many such turbines are in operation.</p>
<p>Offshore wind parks had not yet been built in Arctic or sub-Arctic waters, where sea ice and icebergs may occur. Technically it is possible to build wind turbines strong enough to withstand the forces of sea ice however it will lead to significant increase in cost of the produced energy.</p>
<p>Examples: there are no wind farms in the Arctic yet. A case of The Wind Farm Siting challenge for the Norwegian seas can be found <a href="https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/checkpoint/arctic/challenges/windfarm-siting#:~:text=Offshore%20wind%20parks%20had%20not,wind%20turbines%20do%20not%20allow."><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> effects of wind parks on seal’s behaviour and health are not yet studied. There are surveys showing that harbour seals avoid areas within 40 km from a turbine under construction. Also, there are concerns that turbines can have a long-term impact on seals’ hearing. It is proposed that wind parks should not be constructed in the small, spatially restricted, stable, and well-defined habitats such as coastal haul outs or sea otter coastal habitats, for most of the other conservation features it is suggested that the parks can be constructed once detailed surveys are conducted and areas used by seals regularly identified. The parks should not be in these areas and works shall not be carried during a season when seals can use the habitats as related risks are assessed as non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations. Once turbines are installed a robust monitoring system should be implemented to assess long term consequences on health and distribution of animals. The same approach is taken in the assessment for walrus and cetaceans with a request to restrict potential construction sites to the areas in a distance from whale aggregations where the impulse noise level from construction will be less than 160 dB re 1 mPa peak-to-peak and under condition that service ships keep 5 km away from whale aggregations. For some of cetacean habitats located far offshore “not applicable” status is assigned.</p>
<p>There are studies showing that polar bears can adapt to windmills relatively easily and therefore no restrictions were placed for bear habitats. However, “Significant impact” status was assigned to the sensitive polar bear denning sites.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds</em>: Wind parks have notable impact and should not be constructed near seabird colonies and in buffer zones surrounding them as well as in the areas of well-defined moulting sites or migration stopovers. In other habitats it can only take place under condition that areas where birds regularly concentrate are avoided and strict and robust monitoring is organised once a wind farm is constructed.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> Most of the conservation features representing diversity of fishes are presented at a coarse scale and therefore no specific restrictions on wind park construction are proposed. However, in some spatially restricted spawning areas of mass, commercially important species such as Atlantic capelin, Atlantic herring a ban on any works during the spawning season proposed. There are also year-round restrictions in the feeding/nursery area of the Siberian sturgeon (<em>Acipenser baerii</em>) and in semi-enclosed water areas like river estuaries.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> Wind parks will have significant impact on the areas important for conservation of benthic features except for the deep-sea and far off-shore features such as vents where the assessment status is “not applicable”</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> Risks related to wind park construction are assessed as non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations in the areas important for conservation of coastal features except for the glacial termini features where the assessment status is “not applicable”.</p>
</div>
<div id="coastal-infrastructure-except-oil-gas-infrastructure" class="section level3">
<h3>Coastal Infrastructure (except oil &amp; gas infrastructure)</h3>
<p>Here we considered peers, ports, passenger and cargo terminals, search and rescue stations, recreation facilities or human settlements and other infrastructure objects located in the coastal zone except oil terminals and other oil &amp; gas infrastructure. Their construction is associated with removal or alteration of coastal habitats, disturbance, and destruction of benthic and coastal habitats as well as with increased levels of noise and other pollution including petrochemical pollution since ports usually store a certain amount of fuel supplies. Functioning of such infrastructures is associated with increased human presence, marine and air traffic meaning all the relevant impacts.</p>
<p>Examples: Arctic ports</p>
<p>Marine mammals. Significant number of key habitats of marine mammals are subject to a significant impact from construction of coastal infrastructure, some of them are requiring more detailed distribution studies conducted at local or region level to identify regular animal concentration areas - construction sites should not be located there but can be organised in the remaining parts of the habitats under condition that shipping to and from the infrastructure objects should be limited and restricted (including routing, seasonality, speed and fuel), no waste discharge allowed. In case of cetacean habitats construction works should be kept in a distance from whale aggregations where the impulse noise level from construction will be less than 160 dB re 1 mPa peak-to-peak. Robust monitoring is mandatory, ships should keep 5 km away from the aggregations. For habitats located far offshore “not applicable” status is assigned.</p>
<p>Seabirds. Infrastructure construction has significant impact if happens in the vicinity of seabird colonies and similar spatially restricted and well-defined habitats like moulting sites or migration stopovers. It will have notable impact on some other less spatially restricted habitats under condition that bird concentrations there will be identified throughout additional research and are avoided, and strict and robust monitoring is implemented. Limitations will depend on particular development plans.</p>
<p>Fish. No specific restrictions for fish conservation features apart from existing environmental standards and best practices. For some specific spawning areas, the scale of a project can be limited and more strict monitoring requirements can be introduced.</p>
<p>Benthos. Not applicable for most of the features. Significant impact for areas along the kelp forest habitats.</p>
<p>Coastal features. Significant impact for most of the features. Notable impact for estuaries if takes place at limited scale and under condition that robust environmental monitoring is organised.</p>
</div>
<div id="coastal-oil-terminals-including-other-petrochemical-storing-facilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Coastal Oil Terminals (including other petrochemical storing facilities)</h3>
<p>In addition to the impacts associated with other coastal infrastructure listed in the respective paragraph, oil terminals and other petrochemical storing facilities are sources of operational minor leakages and potential major spills as a greatest possible impact.</p>
<p>Example - Lukoil terminal in Varandey, the Pechora Sea.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> The assessment for marine mammals follows the approach for non-oil &amp; gas coastal infrastructure with even more habitats having “Significant impact” status. “Not applicable” status was assigned to less features as the effects of potential major spills can affect even offshore habitats.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Seabirds are among the most vulnerable wildlife in relation to acute impacts of oil spills. The assessment for seabirds follows the approach for non-oil &amp; gas coastal infrastructure. 100 km buffer zones around seabird colonies or seabird moulting, stopover and wintering sites are assigned “Significant impact” status as the impacts of potential spills and associated oil spill response operations can affect larger areas. Notable impact with risks requiring mitigation through activity-specific and/or habitat/ biotope-specific considerations in other habitats: robust environmental monitoring required.</p>
<p><em>Fish.</em> There are no specific restrictions for most of the fish habitats except for the feeding/nursery areas of Siberian sturgeon (<em>Acipenser baerii</em>) where oil &amp; gas terminals can be a source of significant impact. There are restrictions on works during spawning season in spawning areas of cod, herring and capelin proposed as well as limitations on the scale of potential infrastructure there.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Installation of Oil &amp; Gas terminals can cause significant and irreversible damage to the benthic conservation features; they are a source of even higher potential damage. For habitats located far offshore “not applicable” status is assigned.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features.</em> Oil &amp; Gas terminals are a source of significant impact as their installation causes significant and irreversible damage to the benthic conservation features and are a source of even higher potential damage.</p>
</div>
<div id="dredging" class="section level3">
<h3>Dredging</h3>
<p>Dredging is deepening of the seafloor, for example, for arranging a shipping channel. It is often associated with development of coastal infrastructure and leads to increased shipping traffic in the area.</p>
<p>Dredging causes destruction and elimination of benthic habitats, increases water turbidity and can dramatically change hydrology of an area.</p>
<p>In the process of dredging these impacts are complemented by petrochemical, noise, and light pollution as well as by a physical presence of the dredgers.</p>
<p>Example of substantial dredging in the Arctic seas is the Gulf of Ob’ where the hydrological regime of the gulf was changed because of the large scale and regularly repeated events of deep dredging.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> For most of the walrus habitats dredging is a source of non-mitigable risks as it affects shallow-water and benthic habitats on which they are highly dependent. For the seal ice habitats dredging can have notable impact only under condition that it will not lead to traffic increase in winter/ice season and robust monitoring will be established, also it should not be carried in the areas of regular concentrations of the seals. For cetaceans dredging is a non-mitigable risk activity in the spatially restricted well-defined coastal habitats, can have notable impact under certain conditions for less spatially restricted habitats at limited scale in the areas identified as less important at local or regional scale after dedicated and up-to-date studies. Dredging is not applicable to deeper waters/offshore habitats.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Most vulnerable are benthic-feeders (sea ducks) or active under-water hunters like divers (loons) or guillemots (<em>Uria</em> spp.). Source of significant impact in areas in the vicinity of breeding colonies and, especially, at the moulting, wintering, or stopover sites of the diving seabirds. Source of a notable impact under conditions that works are done off seasons when birds present in the areas which are identified as not in regular use at regional or local scale.</p>
<p><em>Fish.</em> Source of a notable impact for most features if take place at limited scale and under condition that hydrology of the area is not altered, and robust monitoring is implemented.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Source of significant impact associated with non-mitigable risks in the areas where it is applicable.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features.</em> Source of significant impact associated with non-mitigable risks in the areas where it is applicable.</p>

<h2>Oil &amp; Gas Production</h2>
<p>Offshore hydrocarbon production starts with engineering, geological and seismic surveys at the first stage and continues with well drilling, platforms installation at the next stage. Once the production is established the infrastructure requires maintenance and hydrocarbons need to be stored, shipped, and transported. In the case of LNG, it also needs to be processed on site before shipment.</p>
<p>Each stage is associated with various impacts of different scale and magnitude. We assessed the entire complex of the industry-associated impacts for each Conservation Feature as there is no reason to conduct surveys without planning to drill and to start oil production, and once it is produced it needs to be stored and transported and once infrastructure is in place it requires access and maintenance.</p>
<div id="oil-production-off-shore" class="section level3">
<h3>Oil Production (off-shore)</h3>
<p>Engineering and geological surveys typically include drilling of exploratory boreholes, sampling of various geological sediments; geophysical surveys (continuous seismic-acoustic profiling, side-scan sonar, etc.). These surveys are associated with the following impacts: air and underwater noise pollution (from ships, drilling and from seismic surveys), petrochemical pollution (leaks from ships and equipment), light pollution from ships and drilling platforms, physical disturbance, risks of strikes with vessels, and destruction of benthic habitats as well as short-term increase of the water turbidity.</p>
<p>Next stages of oil production are associated with high risk of oil and other petrochemicals pollution including accidental spills, physical disturbance and destruction of habitats caused by installation of platforms and shipping, noise pollution both underwater and in the air (from helicopters), disturbance of the ice cover and light pollution.</p>
<p>Examples: Prirazlomnaya oil platform in the Pechora Sea, Russia; shelf production in Norway and Alaska</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Source of significant impact for marine mammals in most of the important habitats. Source of notable impact in some less- spatially-restricted areas at limited scale and under condition that regular animal concentration areas are avoided, and robust monitoring is installed.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds</em>. Seabirds are among the most vulnerable wildlife in relation to acute impacts of oil spills. The assessment for seabirds follows the approach for no oil &amp; gas production within 100 km buffer zones around seabird colonies or the areas of mass or regular bird concentrations like moulting, stopover and wintering sites, these habitats are assigned “Significant impact” status as the impacts of potential spills and associated oil spill response operations can affect larger areas.

<h3>Gas Production (Offshore)</h3>
<p>Engineering and geological surveys typically include drilling of exploratory boreholes, sampling of various geological materials and geophysical surveys (continuous seismic-acoustic profiling, side-scan sonar, etc.). These surveys are associated with the following impacts: noise pollution (from ships and from seismic surveys), petrochemical pollution (leaks from ships and equipment), light pollution from ships and drilling platforms, physical disturbance, and destruction of benthic habitats as well as short-term changes in the water turbidity levels.</p>
<p>Next stages of gas production are associated with the same risks and impacts as production of oil: petrochemicals pollution, physical disturbance and destruction of habitats caused by installation of platforms and shipping, noise pollution both underwater and in the air (from helicopters), changes in the ice cover and light pollution. The difference is that there is no risk of catastrophic oil spills but there are risks of LNG and other chemical leaks and water warming in case it is used as a cooling agent in the process of production.</p>
<p>Examples: LNG projects in the Western Siberian Arctic</p>

<h3>Mining Other (Offshore)</h3>
<p>Sand is already being mined from seafloor in some areas of the World Ocean. There are plans for deep seabed mining for ferromanganese nodules and rare-earth metals in Norwegian EEZ. Associated impacts from such off-shore mining will be similar to the ones described for off-shore gas production including engineering and geological surveys and associated ship work: noise pollution, petrochemical pollution (leaks from ships and equipment), light pollution, physical disturbance.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will lead to significant impact on benthic habitats including their complete destruction, long-term changes in the water turbidity levels and local hydrological characteristics.</p>
<p>Example: Proposal for deep seabed mining in the Norwegian EEZ.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> The assessment largely follows the assessment for oil production results and is even more strict for some coastal seal habitats.

<h3>Coastal On-Shore Mining</h3>
<p>On-shore mining directly impacts coastal and marine ecosystems through pollution by drains, leaks, and discharges. Also, coastal mining leads to development of coastal infrastructure (ports and terminals) destroying coastal habitats. Their construction will lead to an increase in ship and air traffic with all associated impacts similar to the impacts from off-shore mining - light and noise pollution, oil and other petrochemicals pollution, plastic pollution, habitat degradation etc.</p>

<div id="shipping" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Shipping</strong></h2>
<p>All ships have similar following impacts on marine environment: underwater noise pollution, physical disturbance, biological pollution (transportation of invasive species), risks of collisions with birds and mammals, waste pollution, light pollution, ice cover destruction (especially in the port areas where permanent ice-free channels are kept), shipping channels can also be a reason for dredging with all associated consequences.</p>
<p>Apart from above, the impacts from shipping to a large extent depend on the type of fuel a particular vessel uses and the type of cargo it carries. For example, if a vessel carries oil or petrochemicals or uses HFO (Heavy Fuel Oil) as a fuel scale of impact and pollution can be much bigger than a pollution from a container ship running on LNG. Because of this we divided shipping into the 5 categories: tankers - ships carrying oil and petrochemicals and other cargo and passenger vessels using HFO, LFO, LNG or nuclear power as a source of power.</p>
<p>More about difference between different vessel fuel types and their impact on marine environment is here: <a href="https://www.hfofreearctic.org/en/front-page/"><u>https://www.hfofreearctic.org/en/front-page/</u></a></p>

<h3>Tankers carrying oil and other petrochemicals</h3>
<p>In case a ship carries oil and other petrochemicals it does not matter what fuel it uses for the purposes of the assessment - in case of emergency it can be a source of ecological disaster affecting all components of biodiversity.</p>

<h3>Cargo/Passenger Vessels using HFO</h3>
<p>HFO or marine fuel oil is still the most common type of fuel for ships, it is being used in 75% percent of vessels in the Arctic. It is considered the dirtiest and cheapest type of fossil fuel, which is obtained from oil. HFO degrades very slowly in cold waters, and it is literally impossible to collect it in case of an oil spill. Also, use of HFO causes big amounts of sulfur oxide and black soot emissions. It is already forbidden to use it in the Antarctic, and it is going to be banned in the Arctic after 2029 (<em>The Polar Code</em>).</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Most restrictions are seasonal and dependent on the animal presence. Ships should keep 12 nm away from walrus haul outs during the season. Should avoid known regular animal concentrations (in most cases to be identified at local or regional scale, for cetaceans the distance to concentrations can be identified to keep the noise level below 120 dB per 1 mPa).

<h3>Nuclear-powered Vessels</h3>
<p>Nuclear-powered vessels do not emit any pollutants in the atmosphere and water under operational scenarios. In the case of an accident a vessel can be a source of radioactive pollution of the marine environment. However, during the decades of operation of such vessels, no one accident happened and no pollution emitted. On the other hand, operation of nuclear-powered vessels is associated with other impacts like destruction of sea ice and disturbance of ice habitats, light pollution, risks of strikes with marine mammals and even with seabirds under certain conditions, i.e. in polynyas.</p>

<h2><strong>Fishery</strong></h2>
<div id="bottom-trawling" class="section level3">
<h3>Bottom Trawling</h3>
<p>Bottom trawling is considered among the most destructive types of fisheries and is associated with following impacts: direct physical destruction of the seafloor (trenches up to 40-60 cm depth) and associated benthic communities especially on solid substrates (corals, sponges etc), and siltation. Bycatch can include rays and other benthic species as this method of fishing is non-selective. These specific impacts are complemented by general impacts of shipping - such as underwater noise, chemical and plastic pollution etc.</p>
<p>Examples: bottom trawling is used year-round for cod and haddock fishing in the Barents Sea. Areas affected by the highest pressure are located along the northern Norwegian coast and southern slopes of Bear Island. Other species caught with this method in the Arctic include halibuts and shrimps.</p>
</div>
<div id="snurrevad" class="section level3">
<h3>Snurrevad</h3>
<p>Snurrevad fishing is associated with impacts similar to the ones similar to the ones from bottom trawling - destruction of benthic communities, high level of unselective bycatch. Snurrevad gear is often lost in the process of fishing. Impacts of shipping should also be considered when assessing the environmental impact of this type of fishery.</p>
<p>Snurrevad is used for fishing of walleye pollock and benthic fish species such as cod, flounder, saffron cod, gobies and shrimps. In the ArcNet area it is used in the Bering and the Barents Seas for shelf fishing, normally at depths below 150 m.</p>
</div>
<div id="pelagic-trawling" class="section level3">
<h3>Pelagic Trawling</h3>
<p>Pelagic trawling is the most common type of fishery in the Arctic waters - more than 90% of overall catch is coming just from it.</p>
<p>It is used for catching walley pollock, squid, herring, mackerel, capelin, and other species in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, Greenlandic waters.</p>
<p>Associated impacts: high rate of bycatch including bycatch of juvenile specimens of fished species, small cetaceans. Also impacts of shipping. In Russia pelagic trawls are sometimes used for bottom trawling leading to all the associated impacts even at a bigger scale. This practice is illegal.</p>
</div>
<div id="bottom-dredging" class="section level3">
<h3>Bottom Dredging</h3>
<p>Bottom dredging is used for scallop fishery primarily in shallow and coastal waters of the Barents Sea. Sometimes it is used also in the Bering Sea. It destroys benthic communities in a way similar to bottom trawling. General impacts include ones of shipping.</p>
</div>
<div id="seaweed-mowing" class="section level3">
<h3>Seaweed Mowing</h3>
<p>Seaweed mowing is being practised in the White Sea. Mowing destroys kelp forests and leaves rhizoids making it more difficult for kelp forests to recover.</p>
</div>
<div id="invertebrates-collection-by-divers" class="section level3">
<h3>Invertebrates Collection by Divers</h3>
<p>Invertebrates (scallops, sea urchins) collection by divers is probably the least impactful as it is selective, can be very well regulated and is not destroying benthic communities. It is an expensive way to harvest invertebrates and it is restricted by the first 25 m depth. These factors limit commercial use of this way to harvest seafood now. However, it still has to be considered as a potential activity for a protected area or in the areas surrounding it. Apart from scallops and sea urchin collecting, divers also mow seaweed in some areas in the White Sea.</p>
</div>
<div id="longline-fishing" class="section level3">
<h3>Longline Fishing</h3>
<p>Longline fishing is used for fishing cod, haddock, halibuts, grenadiers mostly in the Barents and the Bering Seas. In the Barents Sea a number of the Russian longline fishing vessels is 10-15 times lower compared to a number of trawlers, however this type of fishery is more common in Norway, where longline fishing vessel number makes a third of the number of trawlers. It can be carried out during ice season at depths between 50 and 1000 metres.</p>
<p>Impacts associated with longline fishing are significantly lower compared to the impacts of trawling - it has almost no impact on seafloor. However, there is a high level of seabird by catch associated with this activity - it is estimated that there are more than 60 species of bird in the world affected by longline fishing gear. Among species threatened by this type of fishery in the Arctic are cormorants, auks, skuas, shearwaters, albatrosses, and gulls. There is several approaches to reduce seabird mortality from longline fishing including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Setting lines at night: Seabirds are primarily diurnal, and setting lines at night when they are less active can reduce interactions with fishing gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Using weighted lines: Using weighted lines that sink quickly can reduce the amount of time that baited hooks are available to seabirds.</p></li>
<li><p>Using bird-scaring lines: Bird-scaring lines (BSLs) are colourful streamers that are attached to the main fishing line to deter seabirds from approaching the hooks. When deployed correctly, BSLs can be effective in reducing seabird interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting lines deeper: Seabirds are less likely to dive to depths greater than 10 metres, so setting lines deeper can reduce the risk of interactions with fishing gear.</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing fishing locations: Avoiding areas where seabirds are known to congregate can reduce interactions with fishing gear. Fishing in areas with lower seabird populations or during times when seabirds are less active can also be effective.</p></li>
<li><p>Monitoring and reporting: Monitoring seabird interactions with fishing gear and reporting any incidents can help identify problem areas and inform future conservation efforts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that no single approach is 100% effective in reducing seabird mortality from longline fishing, and a combination of approaches is often necessary to achieve significant reductions.</p>

<div id="crab-traps" class="section level3">
<h3>Crab Traps</h3>
<p>Crab traps are used in the Arctic for fishing for shrimps, king and snow crab, buccinum mostly in the Bering and the Barents Seas. They are also used to fish for cod sablefish in the Alaska waters.</p>
<p>Crab traps can be used in winter (ice) season and at depths of 150-750 m. If regulated they don’t have much negative impact on the ecosystem apart from the impact on marine mammals - fish eating marine mammals can get caught by the traps, they can continue ghost fishing if lost and abandoned, also there is evidence of bowhead whale entanglements in the ropes.</p>
</div>
<div id="fishing-rods" class="section level3">
<h3>Fishing Rods</h3>
<p>Fishing rods are used for halibut, salmon, cod, squid fishing in the Arctic. They are used in the Bering and the Barents Seas and in the North Atlantic. It is also used to catch mackerel in Norway.</p>
<p>Rods are used for methods of fishing called jigging and trolling.</p>
<p>Specific negative impacts include by-catch of non-target species, littering however the scale of these impacts is relatively small. If such a fishery is controlled and regulated it can be used in the areas surrounding protected areas or in some protected areas as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="purse-seiner" class="section level3">
<h3>Purse Seiner</h3>
<p>Purse seiner fishing is a method of fishing that uses a large net, known as a purse seine, to encircle schools of fish and then close the bottom of the net to trap the fish.</p>
<p>Purse seiners are used for fishing for salmon in the North Pacific, for herring and mackerel in the North Atlantic. In the Arctic they are mostly used in the Bering and in the Barents Seas as it is used in ice free areas only.</p>
<p>It is a very important fishing method for Norway. While purse seiner fishing can be an efficient way to catch large quantities of fish, it is also a non-selective method of fishing allowing for big amounts of bycatch especially of small fish species. Sometimes marine mammals also get caught by a purse seine.</p>
</div>
<div id="bottom-gillnets" class="section level3">
<h3>Bottom Gillnets</h3>
<p>Gillnets consist of a panel of netting that is suspended vertically in the water column with floats at the top and weights at the bottom. The netting is designed to entangle fish by catching them behind the gills, preventing them from escaping. Bottom gillnets are usually set on the seafloor and are anchored using weights or anchors to keep them in place.</p>
<p>In the Arctic bottom gillnets are used primarily in the coastal areas for fishing salmon, lumpfish, and grenadier in ice-free areas or seasons and within depths of 50 m.</p>
<p>Gillnets can be very dangerous if lost as they are not degradable and can continue ghost fishing for a long time. They are also responsible for bycatch including seabirds, small marine mammals, and non-target fish species.</p>
</div>
<div id="drift-nets" class="section level3">
<h3>Drift Nets</h3>
<p>Drift nets, also known as driftnets or drift gillnets, are a type of fishing gear that is used to catch fish that swim close to the surface of the water. They are unique in their construction and operation compared to other fishing gear types.</p>
<p>Drift nets consist of a panel of netting that is suspended vertically in the water column with floats at the top and weights at the bottom. Unlike gillnets, drift nets are not anchored to the seafloor but are allowed to drift with the current, hence their name.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of drift nets is that they can cover large areas of water and are highly efficient at catching large quantities of fish.</p>
<p>However, driftnets are highly unselective and are associated with high bycatch level. Non-target fish species as well as seabirds and marine mammals are often caught in driftnets. These nets often get lost and continue ghost fishing and as they are so big (they can be as long as many kilometres) the damage can be really big as well.</p>
<p>Driftnets are used only in the ice-free areas/season. In the Arctic area they are used in the USA for salmon fishery. It is banned in the Russian part of the Bering Sea.</p>
</div>
<div id="seine-and-stationary-eine" class="section level3">
<h3>Seine and Stationary Seine</h3>
