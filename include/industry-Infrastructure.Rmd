### IUC: Underwater cables {#i74bf0b06}

This human use includes laying and maintenance of submarine communication cables. 

Associated impacts are rather minor, limited in space and in time and include noise and light pollution from laying and service ships, risks of fuel leaks and physical disturbance for seafloor communities and habitats. 
Once a cable is laid its impact on biodiversity is minimal.

Interesting to note that as Wikipedia puts it: “As a result of these cables' cost and usefulness, they are highly valued not only by the corporations building and operating them for profit, but also by national governments. For instance, the Australian government considers its submarine cable systems to be "vital to the national economy". Accordingly, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has created protection zones that restrict activities that could potentially damage cables linking Australia to the rest of the world. The ACMA also regulates all projects to install new submarine cables”.

Examples of submarine communication cables in the Arctic include Svalbard Undersea Cable System (since 2004), Greenland Connect system connecting Greenland, Canada and Iceland since 2009 and many others. There are plans for more such cables in the Arctic including Polar Express with the aim to connect Russian Arctic settlements from Murmansk to Anadyr and further south by 2026 by laying more than 12 000 km of cables according to the Submarine Cable Map. Canada is planning to lay Kattittuq Nunavut Fibre Link from Newfoundland to Iqaluit by 2025 as well. These plans along with others should be explored as potential opportunities for conservation and also monitoring.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Illa sunt similia: hebes acies est cuipiam oculorum, corpore alius senescit; Verum tamen cum de rebus grandioribus dicas, ipsae res verba rapiunt; Quicquid enim a sapientia proficiscitur, id continuo debet expletum esse omnibus suis partibus; Sed ne, dum huic obsequor, vobis molestus sim.

### IW: Windmills, windparks {#ic9838a83}

Offshore wind farms are associated with the impacts like significant noise pollution, risk of seabirds being struck by blades, and behaviour of marine mammals, fish and birds altered (with attraction or avoidance). Among the important effects of wind farms is the unintentional provision of a new habitat which can be rapidly colonized by hard substrate species including non-indigenous species.
Turbine installation process is associated with high level of underwater noise, light pollution, alteration of benthic habitats and all the impacts from service ships which can include potential petrochemical pollution.

### ICI: Coastal infrastructure {#ia37a9ec4}

We considered peers, ports, passenger and cargo terminals, search and rescue stations, and other infrastructure objects located in the coastal zone except oil terminals and other oil & gas infrastructure. Their construction is associated with destruction of benthic and coastal habitats as well as with increased levels of noise and other pollution including petrochemical pollution since ports normally store some amount of fuel for ships etc. Functioning of this infrastructure is associated with increased marine and air traffic meaning all the relevant impacts.

Examples: Arctic ports

### IOT: Oil terminals {#i71fcbdef}

In addition to the impacts associated with other coastal infrastructure listed (hyperlink) in the respective paragraph, oil terminals and other petrochemical storing facilities are sources of regular minor leakages and potential major spills. 
Example - Lukoil terminal in Varandey, the Pechora Sea.

### ID: Dredging {#if24611aa}

Dredging is deepening the seafloor, for example, for arranging a shipping channel. It is often associated with development of coastal infrastructure and leads to increased shipping traffic in the area. 
Dredging causes destruction of natural benthic habitats and changes hydrology of an area. 
In the process of dredging these impacts are complemented by petrochemical, noise and light pollution.
Example - the Gulf of Ob’.
