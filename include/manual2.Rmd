### User Manual

[Geranium](https://wwfarcticprogramme.shinyapps.io/geranium/#section-map) -- online decision support and engagement prioritisation and visualisation tool for the Arctic Seas conservation planners, WWF, relevant government agencies, and other marine planning professionals involved in marine spatial planning (MSP) and ecosystem assessment (EA) processes in the region.

The purpose of the tool is to translate biological information into practical steps for area-based management, conservation, planning and prioritisation.

It is designed to:

-   Make decisions transparent and systematic

-   Organise and facilitate engagement across stakeholders

-   Help identify effective and sufficient conservation measures

-   Prioritise the allocation of implementation efforts, partnerships, and funding

> **Note:** the tool calculates all the statistics and builds maps online (on the flight). Allow three to five seconds for pages to load.

Main Page (Spatial Query)

![](./media/image4.png)

The Main Page is the starting page for all calculations and eresearch with Geranium.

**Spatial Query** - you can select *PACs, MEOWs* or *LMEs* from the drop-down list. Then select a region by clicking on the map to the left. Select *Editor* in case you need to customise area borders. Use "Draw a polygon" and other tools on the left side of the map.

Once an area is selected, choose what conservation features you want to see in the analysis (**CF group**). By default the analysis is done for the "*All conservation features*" group but you can choose one or several taxonomic groups from the drop-down list.

Then choose **Season** for the analysis. By default it shows "*Annual maximum*" (All months) - to show the results of the assessment for all months of a year.

**Activity** drop-down list allows you to choose what industrial activities you want to analyse for the selected area. By default it is "*All activities*". You can choose between 33 activities or select several of them.

Also you can adjust sensitivity of the analysis by using the "**Omit small coverage**" slider to select conservation features for which the selected area plays a relatively insignificant role (up to 5% of their amount).

In case you need to see the overall picture for the ArcNet area with the selected parametres before you select an area, you can see results of the assessments using "Indexes maps". By default the "Do not show" option is on; it can be changed for *CAPR* - to see **Conservation Action Priority Level Relative Index.** It shows relative conservation action priority level for a selected area compared to the average level for the ArcNet area.

The other indexes to see are:

SR - **Significant Relative.** A metric showing how high is the average "significant" conservation concern for a planning unit in a selected area compared to an average value of "significant" conservation concern for a planning unit in ArcNet area. It is used to show a relative overall level of concern (just "red" - "significant" level counted) for a selected area and allows users to compare various areas regardless of their size.

**MNSR - Minor Notable Significant Relative Index.** A metric similar to SR, counting all levels of concern including "minor" and "notable" concerns using the following scale ("significant" - 100, "notable" - 10, "minor" - 1).

**Industrial activities acceptability** - Index showing simple overlap of all the assessment outputs for all selected activities and CFs. It can be useful for the situations when an overview of just one activity acceptability or a level of conservation concern it causes is needed.

**Industrial activities amount** - amount of industrial activities per planning unit. Amount of each activity is normalised (0 - 1.0) and averaged for each planning unit. Shows an overall anthropogenic pressure existing in each area compared to the average for ArcNet.

**Update map** - click "*Update map*" when changing the metric to show.

Once all the parameters are set you can choose "Overview of the selected region". It will lead you to the overview page:

![](./media/image8.png)

On the left you will see the close-up map of the selected region. You can choose to show Existing Protected Areas on the map. Also you can choose to show SR (**Show SR**), MNSR (**Show MNSR),** CAPR **(Show CAPR)** and AAR **(Show Industrial Activities (all))** metric distributions. Also you can choose option "Stats for Existing Protected Areas" (**Stats for EPA**) which will allow you to see the metrics and statistics on the right recalculated for protected areas within the selected region.

On the right side you can see some basic statistics for the selected area (**Basic Statistics**) like:

**No of PUs** - number of Planning Units (30x30 km) within the selected area;

**No of CFs** - number of Conservation Features within the selected area (remember this number is affected by the settings of the "*Omit small coverage*" slider on the Main Page);

**Total area, km^2^**- area of selected region in km^2^;

**Total area, PUs, km^2^** - area of selected region in km^2^ based on PU borders (vary slightly from scrArea);

**Terrestrial Area, PUs, km^2^** - terrestrial part area of selected region in km^2^ based on PU borders

**Marine Area, PUs, km^2^** - marine part area of selected region in km^2^ based on PU borders

Below you can find a graph showing the MNSIA - Minor Notable Significant for Industrial Activity Index calculated for each of 33 industrial activities. Colours of the bars separate different groups of activities (fishery, tourism etc.). The dashed line shows the average index across all the activities and the entire ArcNet area. By clicking "**Domain**" you can see how the index for the selected region looks compared to each activity index for the ArcNet area.

To the right there are "**Top CFs by concern**" showing CFs with MNSCFindex above 50%.

In the lower right part of the page you can find index values for the selected area divided into two groups: "**Concern Indexes**" and "**Activity Indexes**".

**Concern Indexes:**

**SR** **(Significant Relative)** - a SC-based metric showing how big is the average SC for a planning unit in a selected area (SCR) compared to an average SC for a planning unit in ArcNet area (SCR ArcNet). It is used to show a relative overall level of concern for a selected area and allows users to compare various areas regardless of their size.

SR = SCR Selected Area / SCR ArcNet

**MNSR** **(Minor Notable Significant Relative)** - a metric similar to SR, based on MNSC instead of SC, i.e. it includes "notable" and "minor" concerns using the same scale as for MNSA ("significant" - 100, "notable" - 10, "minor" - 1).

MNSR = MNSCR Selected Area / MNSCR ArcNet

**SA (Significant Concern for Area)** - derivative of composition of Conservation Features (with importance of the selected area for each CF taken into account) in a selected area multiplied by a number of industrial activities causing significant conservation concern (with "red" status) in this area for each CF multiplied by a number of months when these activities assigned with "red" status for each CF in the area. Overall the metric shows a level of conservation concern, the intolerance of a regional conservation features composition to all possible industrial activities.

SA = (SUMM (SCa... z) / MAX (SUMM (SCa...z))) \*100% ,

Where:

-   a... z are industrial activities for which at least for one CF for one month the assessment assigned "red" status, "significant conservation concern";

-   MAX (SUMM (SCa...z)) - maximum possible conservation concern level for the selected area if every month, every CF for every activity has the highest possible conservation concern ("red" status).

**MNSA (Minor Notable Significant for Area)** **-** a metric similar to SA with a difference that it considers "brown" and "yellow" statuses as well as "red" one. The formula sums "significant" assessments with "notable" and "minor conservation concern" assessments with the first having a coefficient/weight of 100, "notable" - 10, and "minor" - 1.

**Activity Indexes:**

Based on conservation concern metrics and information on industrial activities distribution conservation action priority metrics were developed to prioritise areas where potential risks (conservation concern) encounter existing industrial activities.

**AAR** (**Amount of Activities Relative)** - amount of industrial activities per planning unit. Amount of each activity is normalised (0 - 1.0) and averaged for each planning unit. Shows an overall anthropogenic pressure existing in each area compared to the average for ArcNet.

**AAR** = AAR Selected Area / AAR ArcNet

AAR Selected Area = SUMM AAR 1-33, where

AAR 1-33 - normalised amount of each of 33 industrial activities.

**CAPR** - **Conservation Action Priority Level Relative**

CAPR = CAPR Selected Area / CAPR ArcNet

CAPR Selected Area = SUMM (MNSR Selected Area 1-33 / AAR 1-33),

MNSR Selected Area 1-33 is MNSR for each planning unit for each of 33 activities in an area,

AAR 1-33 - normalised amount of each of 33 activities.

CAPR shows relative conservation action priority level for a selected area compared to the average level for the ArcNet area.

**CAP** - **Conservation Action Priority** for an area as a whole. It is a sum of MNSR for each planning unit within the area divided by a sum of MNSR maximum possible for all units within the area (in case all CFs have "significant" level of conservation concern and all the activities amount is max in each unit).

CAP = CAP Selected Area / CAP maximum possible for selected area

The graph to the right from the indexes "**Conservation Concern Level by Month**" - it shows the region's MNSA for each month.

**Download interim tables for SR and MNSR -** allows you to download respective tables for this region.

**Instant report** - allows you to download all the information from the page in the form of a pdf report.

Buttons on the lower left side of the page help to navigate:

**Spatial query** returns to the Main Page,

**Selected area details** button opens the table, showing results of the assessment for each conservation feature and each commercial activity within the selected region.

![](./media/image3.png)

You can get to the table straight from the Main Page by selecting the "**Selected Area Details**" button instead of the "**Selected Area Overview**" if needed.

The table lists conservation features within the selected area (**CF name**) along with their ID number and the Cover (**Cover**) - percentage of the CF's total amount within the selected area, SCF and MNSCF indexes for each CF (note that their formula does not include multiplication by *Cover*). You can also range CFs by their SCF or MNSCF values.

Then it shows the assessment results for each activity. 3 - goes for the "red", "*significant concern*" status, 2 - for "brown", "*notable concern*", 1 - for "yellow", "*minor (transitory) concern*", N/A (white) are for the CF areas where an activity is not technically possible. If results of the assessment have seasonal variation, both numbers are shown.

To explore more details on each CF - just click on it and you will see two buttons appear on the bottom-left side of the page: "**CF details**" and "**CF overview**".

If you choose "**CF details**", you will see a page with a table showing results of the assessment for the selected CF for all commercial activities and for each season. By clicking on each line you can read the comments provided by the thematic experts in the top-right section of the page "**Cell comment CF**" and read a description of the industry in the right section of the page "**Industry description**".

If instead of the "**CF details**" you click on "**CF overview**" you will be able to see the metadata of the CF dataset and a map demonstrating its amount distribution.

![](./media/image2.png)

In case you want to comment or disagree with the assigned level of conservation concern you can click on a button showing "**Comments**" for intersection of the activity and the selected CF. It will lead to a page where you can leave your comment and to see if there are other comments regarding this particular output of the assessment under the "**Discussion**" header.

![](./media/image6.png)

To explore more details on each activity you can click on its index (below the table) in the respective column - you will see two buttons appear on the bottom-left side of the page: "**Activity details**" and "**Activity overview**".

"**Activity details**" will lead you to the table with results of the assessment for the selected activity and all CFs. By clicking on each CF you will see comments by the experts and the map showing distribution of the CF.

![](./media/image9.png)

"**Activity overview**" will lead you to the page with the map demonstrating distribution of the assessment details for the selected activity and the description of the activity and a brief overview of the assessment results for each taxonomic group.

![](./media/image10.png)

In the bottom part of each page you can see the navigation buttons allowing you to go back and forth from the starting point and explore results of the assessment for each CF or industry. To go back to the Main Page click on "Geranium NG" on the top-left part of each page.
