<section id="ac-finfish-farms" class="level3">
<h3>AC: Finfish Farms</h3>
<p>Finfish aquaculture is associated with the following impacts on the
marine environment: chemical pollution; organic and genetic pollution;
and introduction of parasites and diseases to the wild populations.
Aquaculture can affect, not only wild fish populations, but also benthic
communities, especially if located in semi-enclosed water areas. It also
requires some coastal infrastructure and an increased level of shipping
to maintain and transport the product.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> salmon, trout and cod aquaculture in Norway,
Iceland, Faroe Islands, and the Russian Kola Peninsula</p>

<section id="fbg-bottom-gillnet-fishing" class="level3">
<h3>FBG: Bottom Gillnet Fishing</h3>
<p>Gillnets consist of a panel of netting that is suspended vertically
in the water column with floats at the top and weights at the bottom.
The netting is designed to entangle fish by catching them behind the
gills, preventing them from escaping. Bottom gillnets are usually set on
the seafloor and are anchored using weights or anchors to keep them in
place.</p>
<p>Gillnets can be very dangerous if lost as they are not degradable and
can continue ghost fishing for a long time. They are also cause bycatch
of seabirds, small marine mammals, and non-target fish species.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> In the Arctic, bottom gillnets are used primarily
in coastal areas for fishing Arctic charr, salmon, lumpfish, and
grenadier in ice-free areas and within 50 m of the surface.</p>

<section id="fbt-bottom-trawling" class="level3">
<h3>FBT: Bottom Trawling</h3>
<p>Bottom trawling is considered among the most destructive types of
fisheries and is associated with following impacts: direct physical
destruction of the seafloor (trenches up to 40-60 cm depth) and
associated benthic communities especially on solid substrates (corals,
sponges, etc.), and siltation. Bycatch can include rays and other
benthic species as this method of fishing is non-selective. These
specific impacts are complemented by the general impacts of shipping
such as underwater noise, chemical and plastic pollution, etc.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Bottom trawling is used year-round in cod and
haddock fishing in the Barents Sea. Areas under the highest pressure are
located along the northern Norwegian coast and southern slopes of Bear
Island. Other species caught with this method in the Arctic include
halibut and shrimp.</p>

<h3>FDN: Drift Net Fishing</h3>
<p>Drift nets, also known as driftnets or drift gillnets, are a type of
fishing gear that is used to catch fish that swim close to the surface
of the water. They are unique in their construction and operation
compared to other fishing gear types. Drift nets consist of a panel of
netting that is suspended vertically in the water column with floats at
the top and weights at the bottom. Unlike gillnets, drift nets are not
anchored to the seafloor but are allowed to drift with the current,
hence their name. One of the advantages of drift nets is that they can
cover large areas of water and are highly efficient at catching large
quantities of fish.</p>
<p>Driftnets are highly unselective and are associated with high bycatch
levels. Non-target fish species as well as seabirds and marine mammals
are often caught in driftnets. These nets often get lost and continue
ghost fishing. As they can be very large (i.e., many kilometres long),
the damage they inflict can be significant.</p>
<p>Driftnets are used only in the ice-free areas/season.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> In the Arctic area they are used in the USA for
salmon fishery (outside of the ArcNet Area). It is banned in the Russian
part of the Bering Sea.</p>

<section id="flf-longline-fishing" class="level3">
<h3>FLF: Longline Fishing</h3>
<p>Impacts associated with longline fishing are significantly lower than
the impacts of trawling, with almost no impact on the seafloor. However,
there is a high level of seabird bycatch associated with this activity.
It is estimated that there are more than 60 species of birds in the
world that are affected by longline fishing gear. Among the species
threatened by this type of fishery in the Arctic are cormorants, auks,
skuas, shearwaters, albatrosses, and gulls. There are several approaches
to reduce seabird mortality from longline fishing including:</p>
<p>· setting lines at night: Seabirds are primarily diurnal, and setting
lines at night when they are less active can reduce interactions with
fishing gear;</p>
<p>· using weighted lines: Using weighted lines that sink quickly can
reduce the amount of time that baited hooks are available to
seabirds;</p>
<p>· using bird-scaring lines: Bird-scaring lines (BSLs) are colourful
streamers that are attached to the main fishing line to deter seabirds
from approaching the hooks. When deployed correctly, BSLs can be
effective in reducing seabird interactions;</p>
<p>· setting lines deeper: Seabirds are less likely to dive to depths
greater than 10 metres, so setting lines deeper can reduce the risk of
interactions with fishing gear;</p>
<p>· choosing fishing locations: Avoiding areas where seabirds are known
to congregate can reduce interactions with fishing gear. Fishing in
areas with lower seabird populations or during times when seabirds are
less active can also be effective; and</p>
<p>· monitoring and reporting: Monitoring seabird interactions with
fishing gear and reporting any incidents can help identify problem areas
and inform future conservation efforts.</p>
<p>It is important to note that no single approach is 100% effective in
reducing seabird mortality from longline fishing, and a combination of
approaches is often necessary to achieve significant reductions.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Longline fishing is used for fishing cod, haddock,
halibuts, and grenadiers mostly in the Barents and the Bering Seas. In
the Barents Sea the number of Russian longline fishing vessels is 10-15
times lower than the number of trawlers; however, this type of fishery
is more common in Norway, where longline fishing vessels make up a third
of the number of trawlers.</p>

<h3>FPS: Purse Seine Fishing</h3>
<p>Purse seine fishing is a method of fishing that uses a large net,
known as a purse seine, that encircles schools of fish, closing at the
bottom to trap them.</p>
<p>While purse seine fishing can be an efficient way to catch large
quantities of fish, it is also non-selective, causing high bycatch
especially of small fish species. Sometimes marine mammals also get
caught by a purse seine.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Purse seines are used for fishing for salmon in
the North Pacific and for herring and mackerel in the North Atlantic. In
the Arctic, they are mostly used in the Bering and Barents Seas and in
ice free areas only. It is a very important fishing method in
Norway.</p>

<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Several key habitats of marine mammals are
subject to <em>significant</em> concern from the construction of coastal
infrastructure. While more detailed distribution studies are required at
the local or regional level to identify regular animal concentration
areas, construction sites must avoid such locations, but could be
situated outside of the core areas under the condition that shipping to
and from the infrastructure projects is limited and restricted
appropriately (including routing, seasonality, speed, and fuel) and no
waste discharge is allowed. In case of cetacean habitats, construction
works should be kept away from whale aggregations where construction
impulse noise levels will be less than 160 dB re 1 mPa peak-to-peak.
Robust monitoring is mandatory, and ships should keep 5 km away from the
aggregations. For habitats located far offshore concern for this

<h3>ID: Dredging</h3>
<p>Dredging is the deepening of the seafloor, typically for shipping
channels. It is often associated with development of coastal
infrastructure and leads to increased shipping traffic in the area.
Dredging causes the destruction and elimination of benthic habitats,
increases water turbidity, and can dramatically change the hydrology of
an area. The impacts of dredging are often complemented by those of
petrochemical, noise, and light pollution as well as the physical
presence of the dredgers.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> the substantial dredging in the Gulf of Ob’ where
the hydrological regime of the gulf has been changed because of the
large scale and regularly repeated events of deep dredging.</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-16" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> For most of the walrus habitats, dredging
poses non-mitigable risks as it affects shallow-water and benthic
habitats on which they are highly dependent and thus is a source of
<em>significant</em> concern. For seal ice habitats, dredging is a
source of <em>notable</em> concern where it should not be allowed to
lead to traffic increase in the winter/ice season, and robust monitoring
should be established. Also, dredging should not be carried out in areas
of regular seal concentration. For cetaceans, dredging poses
non-mitigable risks in the spatially restricted and well-defined coastal
habitats, but can be a source of <em>notable</em> concern for less
spatially restricted habitats where it should be undertaken only at
limited scale in areas identified as less important at the local or
regional scale after dedicated and up-to-date studies. Dredging
activities are <em>not applicable</em> in deeper waters and offshore
habitats.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Most vulnerable are benthic-feeders (sea ducks) or
active under-water hunters like divers (loons) or guillemots (Uria
spp.). Dredging is a source of <em>significant</em> concern in the
vicinity of breeding colonies and, especially, at moulting, wintering,
and stopover sites of diving seabirds. Source of a <em>notable</em>
concern when dredging is only undertaken during the off-season or when
birds are present in areas that are considered not in regular use at the
regional or local scale.</p>
<p><em>Fish.</em> Source of <em>notable</em> concern for most CFs where
dredging can only take place on a limited scale, when the hydrology of

<section id="iop-underwater-oil-gas-pipelines" class="level3">
<h3>IOP: Underwater Oil &amp; Gas Pipelines</h3>
<p>Underwater pipelines are used for oil and gas transportation between
production sites and consumers, storage facilities, and terminals.
Sometimes they are relatively short (a few kilometres) and connect an
offshore facility with the coast. Sometimes they can be thousands of
kilometres long, crossing oceans.</p>
<p>Pipelines are associated with localised disturbance and destruction
of benthic habitats, noise, and physical disturbance during the
construction phase as well as risks of leakages and accidental
spills.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Existing oil and gas pipelines in the Arctic region
are short and connect production sites with export terminals (Varandey,
Russia) or connect two coasts of a bay (Baydaratskaya Bay, Russia).</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-17" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Consensus is that pipelines cause
<em>significant</em> concern for key habitats due to the risks of
large-scale damage in the case of a spill. Pipelines can be located in
some habitats where animals are less abundant, and their densities are
lower, such as whelping or feeding areas for ringed or bearded seals or
areas used by polar bears. The general rules are for construction to:
avoid seasons when animals use the habitat; avoid regular or dense
animal concentration areas; and to have marine mammal observers on board
construction vessels to make sure work is paused in case marine mammals
approach the construction site (in the case of whales, a 5 km exclusion
zone is recommended).</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> A similar approach is used as for marine mammals.
Pipelines are a source of <em>significant</em> concern if located in the
vicinity of breeding colonies and other well-defined, high concentration
areas (e.g., moulting and wintering sites or migration stopovers). They
are a source of <em>notable</em> concern for other habitats and thus can
be constructed only if animal concentrations are avoided and strict and
robust monitoring of installed pipes is implemented.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> The general approach is that pipelines can be laid in
areas important for fish if the strictest environmental requirements and
precautionary measures are taken during the construction and a robust
monitoring system is installed during the exploitation. Construction
works will be a source of significant concern if carried out during
spawning seasons for some fish species, such as capelin, herring, or
cod, which should be avoided.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> Pipelines is a source of <em>significant</em>
concern for benthic features, and risks are considered non-mitigatable
through activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific
considerations if pipelines are laid in the areas where key benthic
features are to be conserved.</p>

non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat /
biotope-specific considerations for the areas where key coastal features
are to be conserved.</p>

<h3>IOT: Coastal Oil Terminals</h3>
<p>In addition to the impacts associated with other coastal

<p><em>Example:</em> Lukoil terminal in Varandey, Pechora Sea.</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-18" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> The assessment for marine mammals follows
the approach for non-oil and gas coastal infrastructure but with even
more habitats being of <em>significant</em> concern. Fewer features were
considered <em>not applicable</em> since the effects of major spills are
widespread and can even affect offshore habitats.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Seabirds are among the most vulnerable wildlife in
relation to the acute impacts of oil spills. The assessment for seabirds
followed the approach for non-oil and gas coastal infrastructure. When
100 km buffer zones are established around seabird colonies or seabird
moulting, stopover and wintering sites, this activity is of
<em>significant</em> concern since the impacts of potential spills and
associated oil spill response operations can affect larger areas. A
source of <em>notable</em> concern with risks requiring mitigation
through activity-specific and/or habitat/ biotope-specific
considerations assigned to other habitats and with robust environmental
monitoring.</p>
<p><em>Fish.</em> There are no specific restrictions for most of the

Restrictions are proposed on works during the spawning season in
spawning areas of cod, herring, and capelin as well as limitations on

<h3>IUC: Submarine Communication Cables</h3>
<p>This activity includes the laying and maintenance of submarine
communication cables. In the Arctic, this human use of the ocean is
currently limited, but plans to develop cable communication are
ambitious and progress over recent years has been fast.</p>
<p>Associated impacts are minor, limited in space and time, but include
noise and light pollution from laying and service ships, risks of fuel
leaks, and physical disturbance of seafloor communities and habitats.
Once a cable is laid, its impact on biodiversity is minor.</p>
<p>Specific requirements for this human use are applied primarily during
the installation phase. They include avoiding areas of critical
importance and often of high seasonal animal concentration (e.g., whale
feeding grounds, seabird moulting sites, and fish spawning areas) and
keeping a distance from marine mammal and seabird aggregations, which
are dynamic and therefore require active observation. To avoid areas of
critical year-round importance, such as benthic and coastal features,
more detailed surveys, mapping and planning are needed at local or a
regional scale.</p>
<p>Submarine communication cables are highly valued by the corporations
responsible for their implementation and operation, but also by national
governments. Accordingly, the Australian Communications and Media
Authority (ACMA) has created protection zones that restrict activities
that could potentially damage cables linking Australia to the rest of
the world. The ACMA also regulates all projects to install new submarine
cables.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Submarine communication cables in the Arctic
include the Svalbard Undersea Cable System (since 2004), the Greenland
Connect system connecting Greenland, Canada, and Iceland (since 2009)
and many others. There are plans for more cables in the Arctic including
the 12,000 km Polar Express that aims to connect Russian Arctic
settlements to the south by 2026 (see TeleGeography, 2023). Similarly,
Canada is planning the Kattittuq Nunavut Fibre Link connecting
Newfoundland to Iqaluit by 2025. These plans along with others can be
explored as potential opportunities for conservation and monitoring.</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-19" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Installation works can be a source of
<em>significant</em> concern for small, spatially restricted, stable,
and well-defined habitats such as core summer habitats for species like
beluga and narwhal during the seasons they use these habitats. Works are
of <em>notable</em> concern for other important marine mammal habitats
with specific consideration such as having marine mammal observers on
board and keeping at least 10 km distance from aggregations of beluga
whales and 5 km from aggregations of other cetaceans, stopping work if
they approach. While there is no recommended buffer distance for seals
and walruses, it is important to note that where cables are laid in
walrus habitats, they should be laid deep enough not to be damaged by
feeding walruses.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> In general, there is a requirement to avoid areas
of seasonal bird concentrations and areas regularly used by birds while
installing the cables. Works can be a source of <em>significant</em>
concern for specific critical habitats (such as moulting sites and
migration stopovers or in close proximity to breeding colonies) during
the time of their use. Cables should avoid critical habitats of benthic
feeding sea ducks such as moulting sites or migration stopovers.</p>
<p><em>Fish.</em> Most conservation features representing diversity of
fishes are presented at a coarse scale and, therefore, no specific
restrictions on development of submarine cable networks have been
proposed. However, in some spatially restricted spawning areas of
commercially important species, such as Atlantic capelin and Atlantic
herring, a ban on any works is proposed during the spawning season.
There are also year-round restrictions proposed on the works in
important semi-enclosed water bodies such as river estuaries.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> The assessment concludes that submarine cable
related works can be a source of <em>notable</em> concern on benthic
features and, therefore, should be undertaken at limited scale and under
the condition that precise planning ensures that the most important
parts of the features are avoided.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features.</em> Works related to submarine communication
cable laying and maintenance is a source of <em>notable</em> concern for
coastal features and, therefore, should proceed only at limited scale
while avoiding the most important coastal features. This is best
accomplished via planning at the local and regional levels.</p>

<section id="iw-offshore-wind-farms" class="level3">
<h3>IW: Offshore Wind Farms</h3>
<p>Offshore wind farms are seen as a green and renewable energy source
and a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel. They are also getting
increasingly efficient and economically viable and thus are likely to be
used more widely in the future. However, they are associated with the
impacts like significant noise pollution, risk of seabirds being struck
by blades, and altering the behaviour of fishes, birds, and marine
mammals (with attraction or avoidance for different species). Among the
important impacts of wind farms is the unintentional provision of a new
habitat that can be rapidly colonised by hard substrate benthic species,
including alien and invasive species. The turbine installation process
is associated with high level of underwater noise, light pollution,
alteration of benthic habitats (in case it is a fixed turbine), and all
the impacts from service ships, which can include potential
petrochemical pollution. More about environmental impacts of offshore
wind parks: <a
href="https://tethys.pnnl.gov/wind-energy"><u>https://tethys.pnnl.gov/wind-energy</u></a>.</p>
<p>Fixed wind farms are usually installed at depths less than 40-50
metres. There are also floating wind farms with turbines mounted on
floating platforms, which can be installed at depths ranging from ca.
100 to 500 m. This technology is still in its <a
href="https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/checkpoint/arctic/challenges/windfarm-siting#:~:text=Offshore%20wind%20parks%20had%20not,wind%20turbines%20do%20not%20allow."><u>infancy</u></a>
and not many such turbines are in operation.</p>
<p>Offshore wind parks have not yet been built in Arctic or sub-Arctic
waters where sea ice and icebergs may occur. Technically, it is possible
to build wind turbines strong enough to withstand the forces of sea ice;
however, at a significantly increased cost.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> there are as yet no wind farms in the Arctic. A
case of The Wind Farm Siting challenge for the Norwegian seas can be
found in EMODNet (2023).</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-20" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Effects of wind parks on seal behaviour and
health are not yet known. Surveys have shown that harbour seals avoid
areas within 40 km of a turbine under construction. Also, there are
concerns that turbines can have a long-term impact on seals’ hearing. It
has been proposed that wind parks should not be constructed in small,
spatially restricted, stable, and well-defined habitats such as coastal
haul outs or sea otter coastal habitats (<em>significant</em> concern).
For most of the other CFs, it is suggested that the parks can be
constructed in appropriate locations once detailed surveys have
identified areas regularly used by seals (<em>notable</em> concern).
Avoiding these areas, works should also avoid seasons when seals use
local habitats since related risks are non-mitigatable through
activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations. Once
turbines are installed a robust monitoring system should be implemented
to assess long-term consequences on health and distribution of animals.
The same approach is required in the case of walrus and cetaceans,
restricting potential construction sites to areas away from whale
aggregations where impulse noise levels are maintained below 160 dB re 1
mPa peak-to-peak and where service ships can keep a minimum separation
of 5 km. For some cetacean habitats located far offshore, this activity
was declared not applicable.</p>
<p>Since studies have shown that polar bears can adapt to windmills
relatively easily, no restrictions were placed on this activity with
respect to bear habitats (<em>minor</em> concern). However, it is a
source of significant concern for the sensitive polar bear denning
sites.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Wind parks are of <em>notable</em> concern and
should not be constructed near seabird colonies nor in buffer zones
surrounding them or in the areas of well-defined moulting sites or
migration stopovers. In other habitats, wind parks can only take place
where areas of regular bird concentration are avoided, and strict and
robust monitoring is organised after construction.</p>
<p><em>Fish.</em> Most of the CFs representing diversity of fishes are
presented at a coarse scale and, therefore, no specific restrictions on
wind park construction are proposed. However, in some spatially
restricted spawning areas of mass, commercially important species, such
as Atlantic capelin and Atlantic herring, a ban on any works during the
spawning season is suggested. There are also year-round restrictions in
the feeding/nursery area of the Siberian sturgeon) and in semi-enclosed
areas like river estuaries.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Wind parks are a source of <em>significant</em>
concern for the areas important for conservation of benthic features
except for the deep-sea and far offshore features such as vents where
the assessment status is considered not applicable.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features.</em> Risks related to wind park construction
are considered non-mitigatable through activity-specific and/or habitat
/ biotope-specific considerations (<em>significant</em> concern) in the
areas important for conservation of coastal features except for the
glacial termini features where the assessment status is <em>not
applicable</em>.</p>

<h2>Mining</h2>
<p>We broadly define mining as the extraction of any non-renewable
resource from the surface of the Earth, including ores as well as oil,
natural gas, sand, etc.</p>
<p>Offshore hydrocarbon production starts with engineering, geological
and seismic surveys at the first stage and continues with well drilling,
platforms installation at the next stage. Once the production is
established the infrastructure requires maintenance and hydrocarbons
need to be stored, shipped, and transported. In the case of LNG, it also
needs to be processed on site before shipment. Each stage is associated
with various impacts of different scale and magnitude. The entire
complex of the industry-associated impacts for each CF was assessed.</p>
<section id="mcm-coastal-onshore-mining" class="level3">
<h3>MCM: Coastal Onshore Mining</h3>
<p>Onshore mining directly impacts coastal and marine ecosystems through
pollution by drains, leaks, and discharges. Also, coastal mining leads
to development of coastal infrastructure (ports and terminals) that
destroys coastal habitats. Their construction leads to an increase in
ship and air traffic with all their associated impacts similar to the
impacts of offshore mining, including light and noise pollution, oil and
other petrochemical pollution, plastic pollution, habitat degradation,
etc.</p>
<p>For the purposes of Geranium assessment, we considered on-shore gas
production here under coastal on-shore mining.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> LNG in Yamal, Russia; Syrodasayskaya Coal Deposit,
Taimyr, Russia.</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-21" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> For most CFs, related risks of this activity
require mitigation through specific considerations in areas where
animals do not aggregate regularly. Risks are non-mitigable in coastal,
well-defined, and spatially restricted habitats such as beluga whale or
narwhal summer aggregation areas or in the important polar bear denning
sites.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Source of significant concern in the vicinity of
breeding colonies. Here, related risks require mitigation through
specific considerations such as limiting scale and comprehensively
adhering to existing environmental standards and best practices.
Implementing robust monitoring in most other habitats is required, not
because they are less sensitive to potential impacts, but because they
need to be defined more precisely at regional and local scales through
dedicated studies. This activity is also of significant concern for
areas of mass or regular bird concentrations.</p>

<h3>MGP: Offshore Gas Production</h3>
<p>Engineering and geological surveys typically include drilling of
exploratory boreholes, sampling of various geological materials and
geophysical surveys (continuous seismic-acoustic profiling, side-scan
sonar, etc.). These surveys are associated with the following impacts:
noise pollution (from ships and from seismic surveys), petrochemical
pollution (leaks from ships and equipment), light pollution (from ships
and drilling platforms), physical disturbance, destruction of benthic
habitats, and short-term changes in water turbidity levels.</p>
<p>Next stages of gas production are associated with the same risks and
impacts as the production of oil: petrochemical pollution, physical
disturbance, and destruction of habitats caused by installation of
platforms and shipping, underwater and air noise pollution (from
helicopters), changes in the ice cover, and light pollution. While there
is no risk of catastrophic oil spills, there are risks of LNG and other
chemical leaks and water warming in case it is used as a cooling agent
in the production process.</p>

<h3>MOP: Offshore Oil &amp; Gas-condensate Production</h3>
<p>Engineering and geological surveys typically include drilling of

air and underwater noise pollution (from ships, drilling and from

<h2>Shipping</h2>
<p>All ships have similar impacts on the marine environment: underwater
noise pollution, physical disturbance, biological pollution
(transportation of invasive species), risks of collisions with birds and
mammals, waste pollution, light pollution, and ice cover destruction
(especially in the port areas where permanent ice-free channels are
maintained). The dredging of shipping channels can also have several
associated consequences as discussed above. Apart from these, the
impacts from shipping to a large extent depend on the ship’s fuel type
and the cargo it carries. For example, a vessel carrying oil or
petrochemicals or one using HFO (Heavy Fuel Oil) has a much larger
potential impact than a container ship running on LNG. Thus, we divided
shipping into the 5 categories: cargo/passenger vessels using HFO, LFO,
LNG, or nuclear as a source of power and tankers (i.e., ships carrying
oil and petrochemicals).</p>

<h3>SHF: Cargo Vessels - Heavy Fuel Oil</h3>
<p>HFO or marine fuel oil is still the most common type of fuel for

dirtiest and cheapest type of fossil fuel. HFO degrades very slowly in
cold water, and it is impossible to recover in case of an oil spill.
Also, the use of HFO causes significant sulphur oxide and black soot
emissions. It is already prohibited in the Antarctic, and it will be

<h3>SN: Nuclear-powered Vessels</h3>
<p>Nuclear-powered vessels do not emit any pollutants in the atmosphere
or water under operational scenarios. In the case of an accident, a
vessel can be a source of radioactive pollution for the marine
environment. However, during the decades of operation of such vessels,
no such accidents or pollution emission have occurred. On the other
hand, operation of nuclear-powered vessels is associated with other
impacts like destruction of sea ice and disturbance of ice habitats,
light pollution, risks of strikes with marine mammals and even with
seabirds under certain conditions, i.e., in polynyas.</p>

<section id="tourism" class="level2">
<h2>Tourism</h2>
<p>Tourism is a growing industry in the Arctic. When undertaken
responsibly, it is usually considered as a positive way to make
conservation profitable. However, overtourism is a common problem around
the world, and in the Arctic, it can be especially harmful as ecosystems
here are fragile and slow to recover.</p>
<p>For the Geranium assessment, tourism was divided into 2 categories:
ecotourism and mass tourism.</p>
<section id="tet-ecotourism" class="level3">
<h3>TET: Ecotourism</h3>
<p>Ecotourism is defined as the “responsible travel to natural areas
that conserves the environment, sustains the wellbeing of local people
and involves interpretation and education” (International Ecotourism
Society, 2015) and includes small-ship expedition cruises and other
small-scale tourism activities. It is characterized by a relatively
small number of visitors, and the dependence of little or no permanent
infrastructure. Expedition ships generally do not land more than 100
passengers at a time at a site and follow industry-specific guidelines,
e.g., those developed by the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise
Operators (<u><a href="https://www.aeco.no/">AECO</a>)</u>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems from
ecotourism is minimal because of its scale and the regulations it
follows; however, on the other hand, ecotourism tends to provide access
to the most valuable and vulnerable areas and wildlife such as seabird
colonies, walrus and seal haul outs, whale aggregations, etc. Many
examples exist that show a rise in the number of visitors can easily
overcome an ecosystem’s capacity unless carefully regulated. Therefore,
by definition, ecotourism is not necessarily compatible with
conservation goals of ArcNet. Regulation should not be outsourced to
industry associations like AECO, but rather should be undertaken by a
conservation community in partnership with other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Restrictions, in addition to existing environmental standards and
best practices, include using light fuel oil (LFO) instead of heavy fuel
oil (HFO), site-specific visiting and wildlife observation guidelines
and site management plans, restricted seasons when visitors are not
allowed access, restriction on use of motorboats, etc.</p>
<p>Associated impacts: disturbance of animals, physical disturbance of
habitats, pollution (including biological pollution - introduction of
invasive species, pathogens, and diseases); in case of ship-based
tourism all ship-associated impacts, including underwater noise, light
pollution, disturbance of ice habitats (ice breaking), risks of ship
strike for mammals and birds.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> expedition cruises by AECO tourist operators.</p>
<p>The ecotourism industry is among the most obvious ally and partner in
conservation and thus should be actively involved in conservation
planning and decision making.</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-30" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Marine mammal CFs are quite diverse and
include small, locally restricted, stable, and very well-defined
habitats, i.e., coastal haul out sites for walruses and eared seals and
seasonal aggregation core areas for some philopatric cetaceans like
beluga whales and narwhal. However, the majority of CFs are more
widespread and dynamic though quite restricted in space such as seasonal
key habitats like summer feeding areas, whelping and moulting patches.
For some species or populations these habitats are not well-studied or
defined, e.g. for the Barents-Kara-Laptev beluga whale stock.</p>
<p>Depending on the status of a habitat’s scale, importance, and
sensitivity, concern levels for marine mammals vary from
<em>significant</em> for polar bear denning sites, steller sea lion haul
outs, and sea otter breeding sites to <em>notable</em> for the majority
of the habitats and <em>minor</em> concern for the remaining CFs.</p>
<p>As most habitats are seasonal, restrictions are also temporary and
seasonal. Restrictions include wildlife watching guidelines, speed
limitations for ships in mammal aggregation areas, marine mammal
observers on board, and specific site guidelines. these restrictions are
best set at the regional and a local scale.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds: S</em>eabird CFs in ArcNet can be divided into three
types: bird colonies and their buffer zones (feeding areas), breeding
grounds, and non-breeding bird habitats with moulting, migrating, and
wintering aggregations. All these habitats are used seasonally, with
birds present only for certain months of their annual cycle. Ecotourism
is also a seasonal activity in that it does not require permanent,
year-round infrastructure and, by definition, is organised in a way to
not leave a lasting impact. Therefore, concern levels vary for seasons
when birds are present in a habitat and when they are not.</p>
<p>The seasonal activity of ecotourism mostly overlaps with seasonal use
of habitats seabird. Thus, for almost all habitats, ecotourism impact
requires mitigation through activity-specific and/or habitat/
biotope-specific considerations if the activity takes place when birds
are present and is assessed as a <em>minor</em> concern when birds are
not using the habitat.</p>
<p>Regulations should include wildlife watching guidelines and
site-specific guidelines that identify no-go zones and areas where
visits are allowed. Developing site management plans is best undertaken
at a local scale. In some areas (e.g. migrating birds concentration
areas in the Chukchi and Bering Sea), black outs on the vessels might be
needed to avoid bird strikes during nighttime.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> As the impacts of ecotourism are relatively minor and
of small scale and since CFs representing diversity of fishes are, in
contrast, presented at a coarse scale, there are no specific
fish-related regulations and recommendations for ecotourism other than
existing environmental standards and best practices.<span
class="math display">\[TJ2\]</span></p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> Benthic CFs in the assessment are represented by
distinctive deep-sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts, underwater
mountains, and areas of increased benthic biomass. These objects
currently and in the foreseeable future are accessible only for
occasional visits undertaken predominantly by scientists and not by
tourists. Therefore, they were considered <em>not applicable</em> for
the purposes of the assessment. However, some benthic CFs include
shallow water and coastal elements like kelp forests and seagrass
meadows. Ecotourism in these areas is of <em>notable</em> concern, and
related risks require mitigation through activity-specific and/or
habitat/ biotope-specific considerations to ensure kelp communities and
seagrasses are not damaged. Limited use of motorboats, speed limits, and
specific site guidelines directing boat traffic out from the most
valuable and dense parts of the meadows and kelp forests may be
required. The development of site management plans is best undertaken at
a local scale.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features</em>: Ecotourism causes <em>notable</em> concern
for the areas where coastal CFs such as estuaries, salt marshes and
intertidal zones are to be conserved. Certain restrictions should be
applied to ensure the conservation of these features. Specific site
guidelines, caps on the number of visitors, may be required.</p>
<p>There are no specific restrictions for ecotourism in the vicinity of
glacial termini apart from existing environmental standards for the
industry and safety measures. However, seabird and mammals feeding
aggregation at glacier fronts should be addressed.</p>

tonnage, whether some of the mass tourism cruise ships taking 600 and
more less passengers have low tonnage.</p>

</section>
<section id="tmt-mass-tourism" class="level3">
<h3>TMT: Mass Tourism</h3>
<p>Mass tourism is characterised by large-scale and developed
infrastructure, including roads and pathways, guest houses, peers,
parking lots, cafes, souvenir shops, etc. Sometimes mass tourism is
responsible for large numbers of poorly regulated visitors in an area.
Vessel-based mass tourism can use large cruise ships (over 400
passengers) as well as numerous small boats in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Mass tourism can be destructive; however, it can take place in some
areas where key CFs are less exposed to its impacts due to their
biological characteristics, or seasonal/spatial mismatch. Additional
requirements and conditions can be introduced besides general
environmental requirements to the industry. Example regulations include
speed restrictions for vessels and vehicles, onboard marine mammal
observers, and use of electric engines or Light Fuel Oil (LFO) for
ships.</p>
<p>Associated impacts: those associated with shipping and coastal
infrastructure (see above), animal disturbance, physical disturbance of
the habitats, and pollution, including noise and light, waste, and
biological pollution (alien species, pathogens, and diseases).</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> polar bear watching tourism in the Churchill area,
Canadian Arctic, and the cruise industry in waters of Alaska or
Norway.</p>
<section id="assessment-findings-31" class="level4">
<h4>Assessment findings:</h4>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Almost all marine mammal habitats considered
for the assessment are seasonal. Therefore, the level of concern may
vary by season except for avoiding the construction of permanent
infrastructure in key mammal habitats. Mass tourism causes
<em>significant</em> concern in small, locally restricted, stable, and
very well-defined habitats especially during the seasons when animals
are present and <em>notable</em> concern for other seasons. Under any
circumstance, mass tourism should leave no trace.</p>
<p>Other restrictions for when animals are present can include: a heavy
fuel oil (HFO) ban, speed limits, marine mammal observers on board,
shipping routes planning, zoning, etc.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> Seabird CFs in ArcNet can be divided into three
types: bird colonies and the buffer zones around them (feeding areas),
breeding grounds, and non-breeding bird habitats with aggregations
during moulting, migrating, and wintering aggregations. All these
habitats are used seasonally, with birds present only for certain months
of their annual cycle. Therefore, the concern level may vary by season
with the exception of avoiding the construction of permanent
infrastructure in key bird habitats. Restrictions may include the
introduction of site-specific guidelines and blackouts for cruise ships
in migrating bird concentration areas at night to prevent bird strikes,
etc.</p>
<p>Note that the assessment of concern level was undertaken at a coarse
global scale and, in some cases, it will be appropriate to reconsider
once finer scale data is available. For example, mass tourism is a
source of <em>notable</em> concern for the CF yellow-billed loon
Atlantic wintering grounds but where regular bird concentration areas
must be identified and avoided. This means that upon finer scale
assessment, <em>significant</em> concern will apply for these
regular/known bird concentration areas while <em>notable</em> or
<em>minor</em> concern will apply for areas at a distance from
concentration areas. This applies to many seabird conservation features,
which is highlighted in the comments section.</p>
<p><em>Fish:</em> CFs representing diversity of fishes are presented at
a coarse scale, and there are no specific fish-related regulations <span
class="math display">\[TJ3\]</span> and restrictions for tourism other
than existing environmental standards and best practices, such as
measures to prevent oil spills, introduction of invasive species,
minimising waste pollution, etc.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> Benthic CFs in the assessment are represented by
distinctive deep-sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts, underwater
mountains, and areas of increased benthic biomass. It is not expected
that mass tours to visit these objects will be organised in the
foreseeable future. However, these areas should be considered as special
areas where all measures to avoid any pollution from passing ships to be
taken. Some benthic CFs include shallow water and coastal elements like
kelp forests and seagrass meadows. Mass tourism in kelp forest areas
requires mitigation through activity-specific and/or habitat/
biotope-specific considerations. Limiting the scale of potential
activities, avoiding permanent infrastructure, limiting the use of
motorboats, speed limits, and specific site guidelines to direct boat
traffic away from the most valuable and dense parts of kelp forests
maybe required. Mass tourism has a <em>significant</em> concern level
for seagrass meadow areas because of the high sensitivity of this
habitat. Related risks are assessed as non-mitigatable through
activity-specific and/or habitat / biotope-specific considerations.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> Mass tourism is a source of
<em>significant</em> concern for the salt marsh areas and intertidal
zones due to their sensitivity. It is a source of <em>notable</em>
concern and should be conducted on a limited scale in other coastal
areas. Recommendations include allowing no permanent infrastructure
construction and the development of individual site guidelines to direct
traffic and outline no-go zones. More specific restrictions and
guidelines should be introduced at the regional and local scale.</p>
</section>
<section id="assumptions-32" class="level4">
<h4>Assumptions:</h4>
<p>We assumed that mass tourism can physically take place in the areas
with any depth and at any distance from the shore. It is also not
restricted by sea ice. We did not consider terrestrial areas further
than 3 planning units (pixels, 90 km) from the shoreline for the
assessment as well as areas located higher than 50 m above the
shoreline.</p>
