<h2>Tourism</h2>
<p>Tourism is a growing industry in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Usually considered as a positive, a way to make conservation
profitable however overtourism is a common problem around the world, and
in the Arctic it can be especially harmful as its nature is fragile and
slow to recover.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the assessment tourism was divided into 2
categories:</p>
<div id="ecotourism" class="section level3">
<h3>Ecotourism</h3>
<p>It is defined as “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves
the environment, sustains the wellbeing of local people and involves
interpretation and education” (International Ecotourism Society, 2015
citation by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489119177"><u>Encyclopedia
of the World&#39;s Biomes, 2020</u></a>) and includes small-ship expedition
cruises and other small-scale tourism activities. It is characterized by
a rather small number of visitors, and absence or minimal amount of
infrastructure and constructions.</p>
<p>Expedition ships generally do not land more than 100 passengers in
the same general area and follow industry-specific guidelines
e.g. developed by <a href="https://www.aeco.no/"><u>AECO</u></a>.</p>
<p>On one hand the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems from ecotourism
is minimal because of its scale and restrictions it follows, on another
hand tourists intend to see the most valuable and vulnerable areas -
bird colonies, walrus and seal haul outs, whale aggregations. Real world
examples show that a rise in a number of visitors can easily overcome
nature’s capacity unless regulated.</p>
<p>Therefore a control and regulations for ecotourism are needed and it
is not automatically compatible with conservation goals in ArcNet.
Regulation should not be outsourced to the industry associations like
AECO but should be done by a conservation community in partnership with
other stakeholders instead.</p>
<p>Examples of restrictions in addition to general industry guidelines
can be use of LFO instead of HFO, specific site and wildlife watching
guidelines, specified seasons when visitors are not allowed in a
particular area, restriction on use of motor boats etc.</p>
<p><em>Associated impacts:</em> physical disturbance, pollution
(including biological pollution-introduction of invasive species and
diseases); in case of ship-based tourism all ship-associated impacts
including underwater noise, light pollution, risks of ship strikes for
mammals and birds.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> expedition cruises by AECO tourist operators.</p>
<p>Ecotourism industry is among the most obvious allies and partners in
conservation and thus should be actively involved in conservation
planning and decision making.</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> marine mammal conservation features are
quite diverse and include small, locally restricted, stable and very
well defined habitats –i.e. coastal haul out sites for walruses and
eared seals, seasonal aggregation core areas for some philopatric
cetaceans like beluga whales and narwhal; majority of conservation
features are more widespread and dynamic though quite restricted in
space seasonal key habitats - summer feeding areas, whelping and molting
patches. For some species or populations these habitats are not very
well studied and defined e.g. for the Barents-Kara-Laptev beluga whale
stock.</p>
<p>Depending on the status of a habitat scale, importance and
sensitivity the assessment outputs for marine mammals vary from “not
allowed” for polar bear denning sites and steller sea lion haul outs and
sea otter breeding sites to “allowed with certain restrictions” for
majority of the habitats and to “allowed with no specific regulations
except for the industry general requirements”.</p>
<p>As most of the habitats are seasonal the restrictions are also
temporary and seasonal. Restrictions include wildlife watching
guidelines, speed limitations for ships in mammal aggregation areas,
marine mammal observers on board, specific site guidelines. This is best
done at a regional and a local scale.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> seabird conservation features in ArcNet can be
divided into three types - bird colonies and buffer zones around them
(feeding areas), breeding grounds and bird aggregations during molting,
migration, and wintering.</p>
<p>Almost all of these habitats are seasonal, meaning that birds use
them only in certain months and leave for the rest of a year. Ecotourism
is also a seasonal activity - it does not require permanent, year-round
infrastructure and by definition is organized in a way not to leave
lasting impact. Therefore the assessment results vary for seasons when
birds are present in a habitat and when they are not.</p>
<p>In almost all habitats ecotourism should be allowed with certain
restrictions when birds are using the habitat and allowed with no
specific requirements when birds are not using the habitat.</p>
<p>Restrictions should include wildlife watching guidelines and specific
site guidelines determining no go zones and areas where visits are
allowed. This is best done at a local scale. In some areas (e.g. bird
concentration areas in the Bering Sea) black outs might be needed to
avoid bird strikes during night time.</p>
<p><em>Fishes:</em> as the impacts of ecotourism are relatively minimal
and of small scale and conservation features representing diversity of
fishes are in contrast presented at a coarse scale, there are no
specific fish-related regulations and restrictions for tourism other
than general environmental requirements for the industry.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> benthic features in the assessment are represented
by distinctive deep sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts,
underwater mountains and areas of increased benthic biomass. These
objects currently and in the foreseeable future are accessible only for
occasional visits done predominantly by scientists not by tourists,
therefore they were assigned “not applicable” status.</p>
<p>Some of the benthic features include shallow water and coastal
elements like kelp forests and seagrass meadows. Ecotourism in these
areas should be allowed only under condition that specific measures will
be taken to ensure the activities do not damage kelp communities and
seagrasses: limited use of motor boats, speed limits and specific site
guidelines directing boat traffic from the most valuable and dense parts
of the meadows and kelp forests. This is best done at a local scale.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features</em>: ecotourism can be allowed in the areas
where coastal conservation features such as estuaries, salt marshes and
intertidal zones are to be conserved. Certain restrictions should be
applied in order to protect these features. Specific site guidelines,
caps on a number of visitors are among these measures.</p>
<p>There are no specific restrictions for ecotourism in the vicinity of
glacial termini apart from general environmental requirements for the
industry and safety measures.</p>
</div>
<div id="mass-tourism" class="section level3">
<h3>Mass tourism</h3>
<p>It is characterised by scale and a developed infrastructure including
roads and pathways, guest houses, peers, parking lots, cafes, souvenir
shops etc). Vessel based mass tourism can use large cruise ships (over
400 passengers) and also numerous small boats in coastal areas.</p>
<p>Mass tourism can be destructive, however can be allowed in some areas
where key conservation features are less exposed to its impacts due to
their biological characteristics, seasonal or spatial mismatch.
Additional requirements and conditions can be introduced besides general
environmental requirements to the industry. Speed regulations for
vessels and vehicles, onboard marine mammal observers, use of electric
engines or LFO (Light Fuel Oil) for ships can be among such additional
requirements.</p>
<p><em>Associated impacts</em>: ship-associated (see Shipping Chapter),
coastal infrastructure-associated (see Infrastructure Chapter) impacts,
specific impacts - physical disturbance, pollution including noise and
light, waste and biological pollution (invasive species and
diseases).</p>
<p>Examples of mass tourism in the Arctic are polar bear watching
tourism in the Churchill area, the Canadian Arctic, cruise industry in
waters of Alaska or Norway.</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Almost all of marine mammal habitats
considered for the assessment are seasonal meaning that animals use them
only in certain months and leave for the rest of a year. Therefore the
assessment status may vary for different seasons except for the general
requirement to avoid construction of permanent infrastructure in key
mammal habitats. Mass tourism should not be allowed in small, locally
restricted, stable and very well defined habitats especially during the
seasons when animals are present there. It can be allowed with general
environmental requirements to the industry in other seasons primarily
under conditions that it leaves no trace.</p>
<p>Other restrictions for the seasons when animals are present can
include HFO ban, speed limits, marine mammal observers on board,
shipping routes planning, zoning etc.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> Almost all of these habitats are seasonal, meaning
that birds use them only in certain months and leave for the rest of a
year. Therefore the assessment status may vary for different seasons
except for the general requirement to avoid construction of permanent
infrastructure in key bird habitats. Among the restrictions are
introduction of site specific guidelines, blackouts for cruise ships in
some bird concentration areas in night time to prevent bird strikes
etc.</p>
<p>Note that the assessment is done at a coarse, global scale and in
some cases it can be reconsidered once a more fine scale data is
introduced, for example current assessment for yellow-billed loon
(<em>Gavia adamsii</em>) Atlantic wintering grounds for mass tourism
says “Allowed with certain restrictions, while avoiding the
regular/known bird concentration areas”, meaning that at the finer scale
the assessment outputs will be “not allowed” for the regular/known bird
concentration areas and “allowed with certain restrictions” or “allowed
with no specific regulations except for the general environmental
requirements to the industry”. This applies to many seabird conservation
features and is highlighted in the comments section.</p>
<p><em>Fishes:</em> conservation features representing diversity of
fishes are presented at a coarse scale, and there are no specific
fish-related regulations and restrictions for tourism other than general
environmental requirements for the industry - measures to prevent oil
spills, introduction of invasive species and waste pollution.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> benthic features in the assessment are represented
by distinctive deep sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts,
underwater mountains and areas of increased benthic biomass. It is not
expected that mass tours to visit these objects will be organized in the
foreseeable future however these areas should be considered as special
areas where all measures to avoid any pollution from passing ships to be
taken. Some of the benthic features include shallow water and coastal
elements like kelp forests and seagrass meadows. Tourism in kelp forest
areas should be allowed only at limited scale under condition that
specific measures will be taken to ensure the activities do not damage
kelp communities and seagrasses: no permanent infrastructure
construction, limited use of motor boats, speed limits and specific site
guidelines directing boat traffic from the most valuable and dense parts
of kelp forests. Mass tourism cannot be allowed in seagrass meadow areas
because of the high sensitivity of this habitat.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> Mass tourism should not be allowed in the
salt marsh areas and intertidal zones due to their sensitivity. It can
be allowed at a limited scale with certain restrictions in other coastal
features. First of all, there should be no permanent infrastructure
construction, individual site guidelines should be developed to direct
traffic and outline no-go zones. More specific restrictions and
guidelines should be introduced at regional and local scale.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<div id="submarine-communication-cables" class="section level3">
<h3>Submarine communication cables</h3>
<p>This human use includes laying and maintenance of submarine
communication cables.</p>
<p><em>Associated impacts</em> are rather minor, limited in space and in
time and include noise and light pollution from laying and service
ships, risks of fuel leaks and physical disturbance for seafloor
communities and habitats.</p>
<p>Once a cable is laid its impact on biodiversity is minimal. Specific
requirements for this human use include avoiding areas of critical
importance and often of high animal concentration (haul out sites, bird
colonies, fish spawning areas, polar bear denning sites) during breeding
and moulting seasons and keep a distance from marine mammal and bird
aggregations which are normally dynamic and therefore require observers
on board. To avoid stable areas of critical importance such as benthic
and coastal features more detailed surveys, mapping and planning are
needed at a local or a regional scale.</p>
<p>Interesting to note that as Wikipedia puts it: “As a result of these
cables&#39; cost and usefulness, they are highly valued not only by the
corporations building and operating them for profit, but also by
national governments. For instance, the Australian government considers
its submarine cable systems to be &quot;vital to the national economy&quot;.
Accordingly, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)
<strong>has created protection zones</strong> that restrict activities
that could potentially damage cables linking Australia to the rest of
the world. The ACMA also regulates all projects to install new submarine
cables”.</p>
<p>Examples of submarine communication cables in the Arctic include
Svalbard Undersea Cable System (since 2004), Greenland Connect system
connecting Greenland, Canada and Iceland since 2009 and many others.
There are plans for more such cables in the Arctic including Polar
Express with the aim to connect Russian Arctic settlements from Murmansk
to Anadyr and further south by 2026 by laying more than 12 000 km of
cables according to the <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/"><u>Submarine Cable
Map</u></a>. Canada is planning to lay Kattittuq Nunavut Fibre Link from
Newfoundland to Iqaluit by 2025 as well. These plans along with others
can be explored as potential opportunities for conservation and also
monitoring.</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Works are not allowed in small, locally
restricted, stable and very well defined habitats such as coastal
haulouts and core summer habitats for species like beluga and narwhal
during the seasons they use these habitats. Works are allowed in other
important marine mammal habitats under condition of having marine mammal
observers on board and keeping at least 10 km distance from aggregations
of beluga whales and 5 km from aggregations of other cetaceans, and that
work will be stopped if they approach. There is no particular distance
to keep outlined for seals and walruses, however it is important that in
case cables are laid in walrus habitats, they should lay deep enough not
to be damaged by feeding walruses.</p>
<p>Cables also should not be located in the sites known to be regular
denning sites and no works should be allowed during the denning season
for polar bears.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> In general there is a requirement to avoid areas
of bird concentrations and areas regularly used by birds while
conducting work during the season when they are in the area. Works are
not allowed in specific breeding habitats (such as colonies) during
breeding seasons.</p>
<p><em>Fishes:</em> Most of the conservation features representing
diversity of fishes are presented at a coarse scale and therefore no
specific restrictions on development of submarine cable networks are
proposed. However in some spatially restricted spawning areas of mass,
commercially important species such as Atlantic capelin, Atlantic
herring a ban on any works proposed during the spawning season. There
are also year-round restrictions on the works in important semi-enclosed
water areas such as river estuaries.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> the assessment concludes that the submarine cable
related works should be allowed within the assessed benthic features at
limited scale and under condition that a more precise planning is done
and the most important parts of the features are avoided.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> it is suggested that works related to the
submarine communication cable laying and maintenance should be allowed
at limited scale while avoiding the most important areas within coastal
features. This is the best done at a local and regional level.</p>
</div>
<div id="underwater-pipelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Underwater pipelines</h3>
<p>Underwater pipelines are used for oil and gas transportation between
production sites and consumer, storage facilities, or terminals.
Sometimes they are relatively short - a few kilometres and connect the
offshore facility with a coast (Norway) or vice versa (Varandey,
Russia), sometimes they can be as long as thousands kilometres
connecting opposite sides of the seas.</p>
<p>Pipelines are associated with localised disturbance and destruction
of benthic habitats, noise and physical disturbance at the construction
phase and risks of leakages and catastrophic spills.</p>
<p>Existing oil &amp; gas pipelines in the Arctic region are short and
connect production sites with export terminals or connect two sides of a
bay (Baydaratskaya Bay, Russia).</p>
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> Consensus is that pipelines should not be
laid in the key habitats due to the scale of potential damage in case of
a spill. Pipelines can be located in some habitats where animals are
less abundant and their densities are lower such as whelping or feeding
areas for ringed or bearded seals or areas used by polar bears. General
rule is to avoid seasons when animals use the habitat for the
construction works, avoid regular or dense animal concentration areas,
have marine mammal observers on board and make sure works paused in case
marine mammals approach the construction site (in case of whales 5 km
zone is recommended).</p>
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> Similar approach as for marine mammals - no
pipelines in the vicinity of breeding colonies and other well-defined
concentration areas. Can be allowed in other habitats under condition
that animal concentrations are avoided and strict and robust monitoring
of installed pipes is organised.</p>
<p><em>Fishes:</em> General approach is that pipelines can be laid in
the areas important for fish under condition that the most strict
environmental requirements and precaution measures are taken during the
construction, and a robust monitoring system is installed during the
exploitation. Construction works shouldn’t be allowed during spawning
seasons for some fish species such as capelin, herring or cod.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> As pipelines impact benthic features the most the
assessment does not allow them to be laid in the areas where key benthic
features are to be conserved.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> The assessment does not allow pipelines in
the areas where key coastal features are to be conserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="offshore-wind-farms" class="section level3">
<h3>Offshore Wind Farms</h3>
<p>Offshore wind farms are seen as a green and renewable energy source
and a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel. They are also getting more
and more efficient and viable economically and thus are more likely to
be more widely used in the future.</p>
<p>However they are <em>associated with the impacts</em> like
significant noise pollution, risk of seabirds being struck by blades,
and behaviour of marine mammals, fish and birds altered (with attraction
or avoidance for different species). Among the important effects of wind
farms is the unintentional provision of a new habitat which can be
rapidly colonised by hard substrate species including non-indigenous
species. Turbine installation process is associated with high level of
underwater noise, light pollution, alteration of benthic habitats (in
case it is a fixed turbine) and all the impacts from service ships which
can include potential petrochemical pollution. More about environmental
impacts of offshore windparks: <a href="https://tethys.pnnl.gov/wind-energy"><u>https://tethys.pnnl.gov/wind-energy</u></a>.</p>
<p>Fixed wind farms are normally installed in the areas with depths not
exceeding 40-50 metres. There are also floating wind farms with turbines
located on floating platforms, which can be built in water depths
starting from ca. 100 m. to ca. 500 m. deep. This technology is still in
its <a href="https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/checkpoint/arctic/challenges/windfarm-siting#:~:text=Offshore%20wind%20parks%20had%20not,wind%20turbines%20do%20not%20allow."><u>infancy</u></a>
and not many such turbines are in operation.</p>
<p>Offshore wind parks had not yet been built in Arctic or Subarctic
waters, where sea ice and icebergs can occur. Technically it is possible
to build wind turbines strong enough to withstand the forces of sea ice
however it will lead to significant increase in cost of the produced
energy.</p>
<p>Among specific requirements are</p>
<p>Examples: there are no wind farms in the Arctic yet. A case of The
Wind Farm Siting challenge for the Norwegian seas can be found <a href="https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/checkpoint/arctic/challenges/windfarm-siting#:~:text=Offshore%20wind%20parks%20had%20not,wind%20turbines%20do%20not%20allow."><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> effects of wind parks on seal’s behaviour
and long term health is not yet studied. There are surveys showing that
harbour seals avoid areas within 40 km from a turbine under
construction. Also there are concerns that turbines can have a long term
impact on seals’ hearing. It is proposed that wind parks should not be
constructed in the small, locally restricted, stable and very well
defined habitats such as coastal haulouts or sea otter coastal habitats,
for most of the other conservation features it is suggested that the
parks can be constructed once detailed surveys are conducted and areas
used by seals regularly identified. The parks should not be located in
these areas and works shall not be carried during a season when seals
can use the habitats. Once turbines are installed a robust monitoring
system should be organised to assess long term consequences on health
and distribution of animals. The same approach is taken in the
assessment for walrus and cetaceans with a request to restrict potential
construction sites to the areas in a distance from whale aggregations
where the impulse noise level from construction will be less than 160 dB
re 1 mPa peak-to-peak and under condition that service ships keep 5 km
away from whale aggregations. For some of cetacean habitats located far
offshore “not applicable” status is assigned.</p>
<p>There are studies showing that polar bears can adapt to windmills
relatively easily and therefore no restrictions were placed for bear
habitats. However “not allowed” status was assigned to the sensitive
polar bear denning sites.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds</em>: Wind parks should not be constructed near seabird
colonies and in buffer zones surrounding them. In other habitats it can
only be allowed under condition that areas where birds regularly
concentrate are avoided and strict and robust monitoring is organised
once a wind farm is constructed.</p>
<p><em>Fishes:</em> Most of the conservation features representing
diversity of fishes are presented at a coarse scale and therefore no
specific restrictions on wind park construction are proposed. However in
some spatially restricted spawning areas of mass, commercially important
species such as Atlantic capelin, Atlantic herring a ban on any works
during the spawning season proposed. There are also year-round
restrictions in the feeding/nursery area of the Siberian sturgeon
(<em>Acipenser baerii</em>) and in semi-enclosed water areas like river
estuaries.</p>
<p><em>Benthos:</em> Windparks should not be allowed in the areas
important for conservation of benthic features except for the deep-sea
and far off-shore features such as vents where the assessment status is
“not applicable”</p>
<p><em>Coastal features:</em> Windparks should not be allowed in the
areas important for conservation of coastal features except for the
glacial termini features where the assessment status is “not
applicable”.</p>
</div>
<div id="coastal-infrastructure-except-oil-gas-infrastructure" class="section level3">
<h3>Coastal infrastructure (except oil &amp; gas infrastructure)</h3>
<p>We considered peers, ports, passenger and cargo terminals, search and
rescue stations, and other infrastructure objects located in the coastal
zone except oil terminals and other oil &amp; gas infrastructure. Their
construction is associated with destruction of benthic and coastal
habitats as well as with increased levels of noise and other pollution
including petrochemical pollution since ports normally store some amount
of fuel for ships etc. Functioning of this infrastructure is associated
with increased marine and air traffic meaning all the relevant
impacts.</p>
<p>Examples: Arctic ports</p>
<p>Marine mammals. Significant number of key habitats of marine mammals
does not allow construction of coastal infrastructure, some of them are
requiring more detailed distribution studies conducted at local or
region level to identify regular animal concentration areas -
construction should not be allowed there but can be organised in the
remaining parts of the habitats under condition that shipping to and
from the infrastructure objects should be limited and restricted
(including routing, seasonality, speed and fuel), no waste discharge
allowed. In case of habitats of cetaceans construction works should be
kept in a distance from whale aggregations where the impulse noise level
from construction will be less than 160 dB re 1 mPa peak-to-peak. Robust
monitoring is mandatory, ships should keep 5 km away from the
aggregations. For habitats located far offshore “not applicable” status
is assigned.</p>
<p>Seabirds. Infrastructure construction is not allowed in the vicinity
of seabird colonies and similar spatially-restricted and well-defined
habitats. It can be allowed in some other less spatially-restricted
habitats under condition that bird concentrations there will be
identified throughout additional research and are avoided and strict and
robust monitoring is organised. Limitations will depend on a particular
development proposal</p>
<p>Fishes. No specific restrictions for fish conservation features apart
from general environmental requirements. For some specific spawning
areas the scale of a project can be limited and more strict monitoring
requirements can be introduced.</p>
<p>Benthos. Not applicable for most of the features. Not allowed for
kelp forests.</p>
<p>Coastal features. Not allowed for most of the features. Can be
allowed in estuaries at limited scale and under condition that robust
environmental monitoring is organised.</p>
</div>
<div id="coastal-oil-terminals-including-other-petrochemical-storing-facilities" class="section level3">
<h3>Coastal oil terminals (including other petrochemical storing
facilities)</h3>
<p>In addition to the impacts associated with other coastal
infrastructure listed (<em>hyperlink</em>) in the respective paragraph,
oil terminals and other petrochemical storing facilities are sources of
regular minor leakages and potential major spills.</p>
<p>Example - Lukoil terminal in Varandey, the Pechora Sea.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> The assessment for marine mammals follows
the approach for non oil &amp; gas coastal infrastructure with even more
habitats having “not allowed” status. “Not applicable” status was
assigned to less features as the effects of potential major spills can
affect even offshore habitats.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> The assessment for seabirds follows the approach
for non oil &amp; gas coastal infrastructure. 100 km buffer zones around
seabird colonies assigned “not allowed” status as the effects of
potential spills can be more significant.</p>
<p><em>Fishes.</em> There are no specific restrictions for most of the
fish habitats except for the feeding/nursery areas of Siberian sturgeon
(<em>Acipenser baerii</em>) where oil &amp; gas terminals shouldn’t be
allowed. There are restrictions on works during spawning season in
spawning areas of cod, herring and capelin and limitations on the scale
of potential infrastructure there.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Oil &amp; Gas terminals are not allowed as their
installation causes significant and irreversible damage to the benthic
conservation features and are a source of even higher potential damage.
For habitats located far offshore “not applicable” status is
assigned.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features.</em> Oil &amp; Gas terminals are not allowed as
their installation causes significant and irreversible damage to the
benthic conservation features and are a source of even higher potential
damage.</p>
</div>
<div id="dredging" class="section level3">
<h3>Dredging</h3>
<p>Dredging is deepening of the seafloor, for example, for arranging a
shipping channel. It is often associated with development of coastal
infrastructure and leads to increased shipping traffic in the area.</p>
<p>Dredging causes destruction of natural benthic habitats and can
change hydrology of an area.</p>
<p>In the process of dredging these impacts are complemented by
petrochemical, noise and light pollution.</p>
<p>Example of substantial dredging in the Arctic Seas is the Gulf of Ob’
where the hydrological regime of the gulf has changed because of the
scale of dredging.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> For most of the walrus habitats dredging
should not be allowed as it affects shallow-water and benthic habitats
on which they are highly dependent. For the seal ice habitats dredging
can be allowed only under condition that it will not lead to traffic
increase in winter/ice season and robust monitoring will be established,
also it should not be carried in the areas of regular concentrations of
the seals. For cetaceans dredging should not be allowed in the
spatially-restricted well-defined coastal habitats, can be allowed under
certain conditions in less spatially-restricted habitats at limited
scale in the areas identified as less important at local or regional
scale after dedicated and up-to-date studies. Dredging is not applicable
to deeper waters/off-shore habitats.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Not allowed in areas in the vicinity of colonies
and in the well-defined breeding grounds. Can be allowed under
conditions that works are done off season and in the areas which are
identified as not in regular use at regional or local scale.</p>
<p><em>Fishes.</em> Can be allowed for most features at limited scale
and under condition that hydrology of the area is not altered, and
robust monitoring is organised.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Not allowed in the areas where it is
applicable.</p>

<h2>Mining</h2>
<p><strong>Oil &amp; Gas Production</strong></p>
<p>Offshore hydrocarbon production starts with engineering and
geological surveys at the first stage and continues with well drilling,
platforms installation at the next stage. Once the production is
established the infrastructure requires maintenance and hydrocarbons
need to be stored and transported. In case of LNG it also needs to be
processed on site before transportation.</p>
<p>Each stage is associated with various impacts of different scale and
intensity. We assessed the entire complex of the industry-associated
impacts for each Conservation Feature as there is no reason to conduct
surveys without planning to drill and to start oil production, and once
it is produced it needs to be stored and transported and once
infrastructure is there it requires access and maintenance.</p>
<div id="oil-production" class="section level3">
<h3>Oil Production</h3>
<p>Engineering and geological surveys typically include: drilling of
exploratory boreholes, sampling of various geological materials;
geophysical surveys (continuous seismoacoustic profiling, side-scan
sonar, etc.). These surveys are associated with the following impacts:
noise pollution (from ships and from seismic surveys), petrochemical
pollution (leaks from ships and equipment), light pollution from ships
and drilling platforms, physical disturbance and destruction of benthic
habitats as well as short-term changes in the water turbidity
levels.</p>
<p>Next stages of oil production are associated with high risk of oil
and other petrochemicals pollution including catastrophic one, physical
disturbance and destruction of habitats caused by installation of
platforms and shipping, noise pollution both underwater and in the air
(from helicopters), changes in the ice cover and light pollution.</p>
<p>Examples: Prirazlomnaya in the Pechora Sea, Norway, Alaska</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Not allowed in most of the important
habitats. Can be allowed in some less- spatially-restricted areas at
limited scale and under condition that regular animal concentration
areas are avoided, and robust monitoring is installed.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds</em>. Not allowed in the vicinity of breeding colonies
and can be allowed at limited scale and with all the environmental
requirements observed and monitoring installed in most of the other
habitats not because they are less sensitive to potential impacts but
because they need to be defined more precisely at regional and local
scales throughout dedicated studies. Not allowed in the areas of mass or
regular bird concentrations</p>
<p><em>Fishes.</em> Can be allowed at limited scale and with all the
environmental requirements observed and monitoring installed for most of
the features with “not allowed” status for some restricted features as
local forms of the White-Sea herring (<em>Clupea pallasii</em>) habitats
or estuarine complexes.</p>

<h3>Gas production</h3>
<p>Engineering and geological surveys typically include: drilling of
exploratory boreholes, sampling of various geological materials;
geophysical surveys (continuous seismoacoustic profiling, side-scan
sonar, etc.). These surveys are associated with the following impacts:
noise pollution (from ships and from seismic surveys), petrochemical
pollution (leaks from ships and equipment), light pollution from ships
and drilling platforms, physical disturbance and destruction of benthic
habitats as well as short-term changes in the water turbidity
levels.</p>
<p>Next stages of gas production are associated with the same risks and
impacts as production of oil: petrochemicals pollution, physical
disturbance and destruction of habitats caused by installation of
platforms and shipping, noise pollution both underwater and in the air
(from helicopters), changes in the ice cover and light pollution. The
difference is that there is no risk of catastrophic oil spills but there
are risks of LNG and other chemical leaks and also water warming in case
it is used as a cooling agent in the process of production.</p>
<p>Examples: LNG projects in the Western Siberian Arctic</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Gas production assessment follows the
assessment for the oil production with less restrictions for some
features. It can be allowed at limited scale and with all the
environmental requirements observed and monitoring installed and not
closer than 10 km from any regular aggregation area for some
cetaceans.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Not allowed in the vicinity of breeding colonies
and can be allowed at limited scale and with all the environmental
requirements observed and monitoring installed in most of the other
habitats not because they are less sensitive to potential impacts but
because they need to be defined more precisely at regional and local
scales throughout dedicated studies. Not allowed in the areas of mass or
regular bird concentrations</p>
<p><em>Fishes.</em> Can be allowed at limited scale and with all the
environmental requirements observed and monitoring installed for most of
the features.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Not allowed due to sensitivity of the habitats and
a scale of potential harm.</p>
<p><em>Coastal features.</em> Not allowed due to sensitivity of the
habitats and a scale of potential harm.</p>

<div id="other-off-shore-mining" class="section level3">
<h3>Other off-shore mining</h3>
<p>Sand is already being mined from seafloor in some areas of the World
Ocean. There are plans for deep seabed mining for ferromanganese nodules
and rare-earth metals. Associated impacts from such off-shore mining
will be similar to the ones described for off-shore gas production
including engineering and geological surveys and associated ship work:
noise pollution, petrochemical pollution (leaks from ships and
equipment), light pollution, physical disturbance.</p>
<p>Additionally it will lead to significant impact on benthic habitats
including their complete destruction, long-term changes in the water
turbidity levels and local hydrological characteristics.</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> The assessment largely follows the
assessment for oil production results and is even more strict for some
coastal seal habitats. For cetaceans it follows the assessment for gas
production with conditions that it can be allowed for some features at
limited scale and with all the environmental requirements observed and
monitoring installed. Ships should not operate in areas closer than 5 km
to any whales.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Not allowed in the vicinity of breeding colonies

<div id="coastal-on-shore-mining" class="section level3">
<h3>Coastal on-shore mining</h3>
<p>On-shore mining directly impacts coastal and marine ecosystems
through pollution by drains, leaks and discharges. Also coastal mining
leads to development of coastal infrastructure (ports and terminals)
destroying coastal habitats. Their construction will lead to an increase
in ship and air traffic with all associated impacts similar to the
impacts from off-shore mining - light and noise pollution, oil and other
petrochemicals pollution, plastic pollution, habitat degradation
etc.</p>
<p>Examples: LNG in Yamal, Russia, Nornickel, Russia, coal (?)</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Can be allowed under certain conditions in
the areas where animals don&#39;t aggregate regularly for most of the
features. Not allowed in coastal well-defined spatially restricted
habitats such as beluga whale or narwhal summer aggregation areas or in
the important polar bear denning sites.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Not allowed in the vicinity of breeding colonies
and can be allowed at limited scale and with all the environmental
requirements observed and monitoring installed in most of the other

because they need to be defined more precisely at regional and local
scales throughout dedicated studies. Not allowed in the areas of mass or
regular bird concentrations</p>
<p><em>Fishes.</em> Can be allowed in most of the features under
conditions that it is of limited scale and that a robust monitoring
system is installed.</p>
<p><em>Benthos.</em> Not allowed due to sensitivity of the features and

<p><em>Coastal features</em>. Not allowed due to sensitivity of the

<div id="shipping" class="section level2">
<h2>Shipping</h2>
<p>All ships have similar following impacts on marine environment:
underwater noise pollution, physical disturbance, biological pollution
(transportation of invasive species), risks of collisions with birds and
mammals, waste pollution, light pollution, ice cover destruction
(especially in the port areas where permanent ice-free channels are
kept), shipping channels can also be a reason for dredging with all
associated consequences.</p>
<p>Apart from this the impacts from shipping to a large extent depend on
the type of fuel a particular vessel uses and the type of cargo it
carries. For example if a vessel carries oil or petrochemicals or uses
HFO (Heavy Fuel Oil) as a fuel scale of impact and pollution can be much
bigger than a pollution from a container ship running on LNG. Because of
this we divided shipping into the 5 categories: tankers - ships carrying
oil and petrochemicals and other cargo and passenger vessels using HFO,
LFO, LNG or nuclear power as a source of power.</p>
<p>More about difference between different vessel fuel types and their
impact on marine environment is here: <a href="https://www.hfofreearctic.org/en/front-page/"><u>https://www.hfofreearctic.org/en/front-page/</u></a></p>
<div id="tankers-carrying-oil-and-other-petrochemicals" class="section level3">
<h3>Tankers carrying oil and other petrochemicals</h3>
<p>In case a ship carries oil and other petrochemicals it does not
matter what fuel it uses for the purposes of the assessment - in case of
emergency it can be a source of ecological disaster affecting all
components of biodiversity.</p>
<p>Examples: tankers carrying oil from Varandey, the Pechora Sea across
the Barents Sea, <em>Alaska?</em></p>
<p><em>Briefly describe distribution of tanker shipping routes in the

<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Not allowed in most important habitats
during the season when they are used by animals. Can be allowed for
double-hulled tankers off season and with certain restrictions: speed
limit, marine mammal observers on board, be ready for maneuvering, keep
away from animal concentrations (if there are some).</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Can be allowed for most of the habitats under
condition that importance of the area for birds is considered in Oil
Spill Contigency Plans, tankers are double hulled. Not allowed for
important habitats of spectacled and Steller’s eider.</p>
<p><em>Fishes.</em> No restrictions for many fish habitats and
restrictions on scale and intensity of operations for some areas. This
allows for double-hulled tankers only.</p>

<div id="cargopassenger-vessel-using-hfo" class="section level3">
<h3>Cargo/Passenger Vessel using HFO</h3>
<p>HFO or marine fuel oil is still the most common type of fuel for
ships, it is being used in 75% percent of vessels in the Arctic. It is
considered the dirtiest and cheapest type of fossil fuel, which is
obtained from oil. HFO degrades very slowly in cold waters, and it is
literally impossible to collect it in case of an oil spill. Also use of
HFO causes big amounts of sulfur oxide and black soot emissions. It is
already forbidden to use it in the Antarctic and it is going to be
banned in the Arctic after 2029 (<em>The Polar Code</em>).</p>
<p><em>Marine mammals.</em> Most restrictions are seasonal and dependent
on the animal presence. Ships should keep 12 nm away from walrus
haulouts during the season. Should avoid known regular animal
concentrations (in most cases to be identified at local or regional
scale, for cetaceans the distance to concentrations can be identified to
keep the noise level below 120 dB per 1 mPa). Often marine mammal
observers on board and introduction of speed limits will be
required.</p>
<p><em>Seabirds.</em> Can be allowed for most of the habitats under

<h3>Cargo/Passenger Vessel using LFO</h3>
<p>Light Fuel Oil or marine gasoil is a ship fuel with a lower amount of

<p>Liquified Natural Gas, LNG considered to be a relatively ecological
alternative fuel. Its sulfur oxide level is 95% lower than in HFO and

<h2>Aquaculture</h2>
<div id="cages-for-salmon-cod-or-other-fish-species" class="section level3">
<h3>Cages for salmon, cod or other fish species</h3>
<p>This type of aquaculture can be associated with the following impacts
on marine environment: chemical pollution, genetic and organic
pollution, spread of parasites and infections from cages into the wild
populations. It affects not only wild populations but also benthic
communities especially if located in semi-enclosed water areas. It also
requires some coastal infrastructure and an increased level of shipping
to maintain and transport the product.</p>
