  <h2>Tourism</h2>
  <p>Tourism is a growing industry in the Arctic.</p>
  <p>Usually considered as a positive, a way to make conservation&#13;
profitable however overtourism is a common problem around the world, and&#13;
in the Arctic it can be especially harmful as its nature is fragile and&#13;
slow to recover.</p>
  <p>For the purpose of the assessment tourism was divided into 2&#13;
categories:</p>
  <div id="ecotourism" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Ecotourism</h3>&#13;
<p>It is defined as “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves&#13;
the environment, sustains the wellbeing of local people and involves&#13;
interpretation and education” (International Ecotourism Society, 2015&#13;
citation by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489119177"><u>Encyclopedia&#13;
of the World's Biomes, 2020</u></a>) and includes small-ship expedition&#13;
cruises and other small-scale tourism activities. It is characterized by&#13;
a rather small number of visitors, and absence or minimal amount of&#13;
infrastructure and constructions.</p>&#13;
<p>Expedition ships generally do not land more than 100 passengers in&#13;
the same general area and follow industry-specific guidelines&#13;
e.g. developed by <a href="https://www.aeco.no/"><u>AECO</u></a>.</p>&#13;
<p>On one hand the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems from ecotourism&#13;
is minimal because of its scale and restrictions it follows, on another&#13;
hand tourists intend to see the most valuable and vulnerable areas -&#13;
bird colonies, walrus and seal haul outs, whale aggregations. Real world&#13;
examples show that a rise in a number of visitors can easily overcome&#13;
nature’s capacity unless regulated.</p>&#13;
<p>Therefore a control and regulations for ecotourism are needed and it&#13;
is not automatically compatible with conservation goals in ArcNet.&#13;
Regulation should not be outsourced to the industry associations like&#13;
AECO but should be done by a conservation community in partnership with&#13;
other stakeholders instead.</p>&#13;
<p>Examples of restrictions in addition to general industry guidelines&#13;
can be use of LFO instead of HFO, specific site and wildlife watching&#13;
guidelines, specified seasons when visitors are not allowed in a&#13;
particular area, restriction on use of motor boats etc.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Associated impacts:</em> physical disturbance, pollution&#13;
(including biological pollution-introduction of invasive species and&#13;
diseases); in case of ship-based tourism all ship-associated impacts&#13;
including underwater noise, light pollution, risks of ship strikes for&#13;
mammals and birds.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Examples:</em> expedition cruises by AECO tourist operators.</p>&#13;
<p>Ecotourism industry is among the most obvious allies and partners in&#13;
conservation and thus should be actively involved in conservation&#13;
planning and decision making.</p>&#13;
<p>Overview of the assessment outputs:</p>&#13;
<p><em>Marine mammals:</em> marine mammal conservation features are&#13;
quite diverse and include small, locally restricted, stable and very&#13;
well defined habitats –i.e. coastal haul out sites for walruses and&#13;
eared seals, seasonal aggregation core areas for some philopatric&#13;
cetaceans like beluga whales and narwhal; majority of conservation&#13;
features are more widespread and dynamic though quite restricted in&#13;
space seasonal key habitats - summer feeding areas, whelping and molting&#13;
patches. For some species or populations these habitats are not very&#13;
well studied and defined e.g. for the Barents-Kara-Laptev beluga whale&#13;
stock.</p>&#13;
<p>Depending on the status of a habitat scale, importance and&#13;
sensitivity the assessment outputs for marine mammals vary from “not&#13;
allowed” for polar bear denning sites and steller sea lion haul outs and&#13;
sea otter breeding sites to “allowed with certain restrictions” for&#13;
majority of the habitats and to “allowed with no specific regulations&#13;
except for the industry general requirements”.</p>&#13;
<p>As most of the habitats are seasonal the restrictions are also&#13;
temporary and seasonal. Restrictions include wildlife watching&#13;
guidelines, speed limitations for ships in mammal aggregation areas,&#13;
marine mammal observers on board, specific site guidelines. This is best&#13;
done at a regional and a local scale.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Seabirds:</em> seabird conservation features in ArcNet can be&#13;
divided into three types - bird colonies and buffer zones around them&#13;
(feeding areas), breeding grounds and bird aggregations during molting,&#13;
migration, and wintering.</p>&#13;
<p>Almost all of these habitats are seasonal, meaning that birds use&#13;
them only in certain months and leave for the rest of a year. Ecotourism&#13;
is also a seasonal activity - it does not require permanent, year-round&#13;
infrastructure and by definition is organized in a way not to leave&#13;
lasting impact. Therefore the assessment results vary for seasons when&#13;
birds are present in a habitat and when they are not.</p>&#13;
<p>In almost all habitats ecotourism should be allowed with certain&#13;
restrictions when birds are using the habitat and allowed with no&#13;
specific requirements when birds are not using the habitat.</p>&#13;
<p>Restrictions should include wildlife watching guidelines and specific&#13;
site guidelines determining no go zones and areas where visits are&#13;
allowed. This is best done at a local scale. In some areas (e.g. bird&#13;
concentration areas in the Bering Sea) black outs might be needed to&#13;
avoid bird strikes during night time.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Fishes:</em> as the impacts of ecotourism are relatively minimal&#13;
and of small scale and conservation features representing diversity of&#13;
fishes are in contrast presented at a coarse scale, there are no&#13;
specific fish-related regulations and restrictions for tourism other&#13;
than general environmental requirements for the industry.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Benthos:</em> benthic features in the assessment are represented&#13;
by distinctive deep sea objects like vents, cold corals, rifts,&#13;
underwater mountains and areas of increased benthic biomass. These&#13;
objects currently and in the foreseeable future are accessible only for&#13;
occasional visits done predominantly by scientists not by tourists,&#13;
therefore they were assigned “not applicable” status.</p>&#13;
<p>Some of the benthic features include shallow water and coastal&#13;
elements like kelp forests and seagrass meadows. Ecotourism in these&#13;
areas should be allowed only under condition that specific measures will&#13;
be taken to ensure the activities do not damage kelp communities and&#13;
seagrasses: limited use of motor boats, speed limits and specific site&#13;
guidelines directing boat traffic from the most valuable and dense parts&#13;
of the meadows and kelp forests. This is best done at a local scale.</p>&#13;
<p><em>Coastal features</em>: ecotourism can be allowed in the areas&#13;
where coastal conservation features such as estuaries, salt marshes and&#13;
intertidal zones are to be conserved. Certain restrictions should be&#13;
applied in order to protect these features. Specific site guidelines,&#13;
caps on a number of visitors are among these measures.</p>&#13;
<p>There are no specific restrictions for ecotourism in the vicinity of&#13;
glacial termini apart from general environmental requirements for the&#13;
industry and safety measures.</p>&#13;
